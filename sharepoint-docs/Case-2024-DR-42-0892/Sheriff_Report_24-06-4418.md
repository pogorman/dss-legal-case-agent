## I. INCIDENT SUMMARY

On June 12, 2024, at approximately 1100 hours, the undersigned, Lt. Frank Odom of the Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office, Criminal Investigations Division, responded to Spartanburg Medical Center, 101 East Wood Street, Spartanburg, SC, in reference to a report of suspected child abuse involving a three-year-old male child identified as Jaylen Webb (DOB: 04/08/2021).

Upon arrival at the Spartanburg Medical Center Emergency Department, the undersigned was directed to Treatment Room 4, where the victim, Jaylen Webb, was being treated by attending medical staff. The undersigned observed the following injuries on the child:

1. Bruising to the upper left arm, consistent with grip marks, approximately 2.5 inches in length.
2. A contusion to the right temporal region of the head, with mild swelling.
3. Minor abrasions to both knees.

The undersigned interviewed the attending ER nursing staff, specifically Charge Nurse Patricia Daniels, RN (Employee ID: SMC-4492). Nurse Daniels stated that the child was brought into the Emergency Department at approximately 0047 hours on June 12, 2024, by the child's mother, Dena Holloway, and the child's father, Marcus Webb. Nurse Daniels stated that the parents reported the child had fallen from his crib. Nurse Daniels further stated that in her professional assessment, the pattern of bruising on the child's upper arm was not consistent with a fall from a crib and was more consistent with the child being grabbed or restrained with force. Nurse Daniels indicated that hospital staff initiated a mandatory report to the South Carolina Department of Social Services (DSS) at approximately 0115 hours.

The undersigned requested coordination with the Spartanburg County DSS office and was advised that DSS Investigator Sarah Mitchell had been assigned to the case.

The undersigned noted that at the time this statement was made, the subject had not yet been informed that Holloway had made any assertions about his presence in the child's room. The undersigned asked the subject to clarify his statement. Subject paused and then stated, "I just assumed that's what she's saying because she's been trying to blame me for things lately." Subject did not elaborate further on this point.

The undersigned asked the subject if he would consent to a search of the residence. Subject stated he would need to think about it and consult with an attorney before agreeing to any search. The interview was concluded at approximately 1455 hours.

--- Page 7 ---

The subject then provided the following revised statement:

> "Actually, I need to correct something. Around 9:30 PM I heard a loud thump from Jaylen's room. I assumed Marcus was in there. I called out and Marcus said everything was fine. I did not check on Jaylen at that time."

The undersigned asked the subject why she did not initially disclose this information to hospital staff or to the undersigned during the initial contact at the hospital. Subject stated she was "scared" and "didn't want to get anyone in trouble." Subject stated she had been thinking about it since the hospital visit and felt she needed to tell the truth.

The undersigned asked the subject to clarify the timeline. Subject confirmed the following sequence of events: Marcus Webb put the child to bed at approximately 8:00 PM. Webb returned to the living room. At some point thereafter, the subject stated she believed Webb returned to the child's room, though she could not specify the exact time. At approximately 9:30 PM, the subject heard a loud thump originating from the direction of the child's bedroom. The subject called out to Webb. Webb responded verbally that "everything was fine." The subject did not physically check on the child at that time. The subject stated she fell asleep on the couch.

---

--- Page 8 ---

The undersigned asked the subject whether she had ever observed Marcus Webb behave aggressively or use excessive force with the child on any prior occasion. The subject provided the following statement:

> "Marcus has a temper. He gets frustrated when Jaylen won't stop crying. I have seen him grab Jaylen roughly by the arm before, maybe two or three times. I should have said something sooner."

The undersigned asked the subject to describe these prior incidents in detail. Subject stated that on approximately three occasions over the past several months, she observed Webb grab the child by the upper arm in a manner she described as "too rough" when the child was crying or refusing to cooperate with bedtime. Subject stated that on none of these occasions did the child appear to be injured afterward. Subject stated she verbally confronted Webb about the behavior and that Webb told her she was "overreacting."

The undersigned asked the subject whether she had any direct knowledge of what caused the child's injuries on the night of June 11, 2024. Subject stated she did not directly witness any incident but believed, based on the thump she heard and Webb's presence near the child's room, that Webb was responsible.

The interview was concluded at approximately 1715 hours. Subject was advised that the investigation was ongoing and that she may be contacted for further questioning. Subject acknowledged and departed the Sheriff's Office without incident.

# GUARDIAN AD LITEM REPORT

---

**Filed:** February 8, 2024
**Before:** The Honorable Harold Wynn, Family Court Judge
**Guardian ad Litem:** Thomas Reed, appointed September 14, 2023

---

## I. APPOINTMENT AND QUALIFICATIONS

**p. 1**

1. I, Thomas Reed, was appointed by this Court as Guardian ad Litem for the minor children Amari Price (DOB 9/28/2017) and Destiny Price (DOB 5/14/2019) on September 14, 2023. I am a certified Guardian ad Litem through the South Carolina Guardian ad Litem Program and have served in this capacity for approximately six years.

2. My role as GAL is to advocate for the best interests of the children before this Court. In carrying out my duties, I have reviewed relevant DSS case records, attended court hearings, and conducted independent visits with the children in their foster placement.

## II. VISITS AND OBSERVATIONS

3. Since my appointment, I have visited the minor children three times in the home of their foster parents, the Patterson family, in Richland County. My visits took place on October 7, 2023; December 2, 2023; and January 20, 2024.

4. **Visit 1 — October 7, 2023:** During my first visit, both children had been in the Patterson home for approximately two months. Amari was adjusting to his new school and appeared quiet but responsive. Destiny was initially shy but warmed up during the visit. The Patterson home was clean, well-organized, and child-appropriate. Both children had their own beds, clothing, and age-appropriate belongings. The Pattersons were attentive, patient, and clearly invested in the well-being of both children.

5. **Visit 2 — December 2, 2023:** By my second visit, both children had made noticeable progress. Amari was more talkative and told me about his school friends and activities. His foster mother reported that his grades had improved and he was performing at grade level. Destiny was more comfortable and playful, and had begun attending pre-kindergarten. She was engaging with other children and her teachers reported no behavioral concerns. The Pattersons described a consistent daily routine including meals, homework time, and bedtime.

6. **Visit 3 — January 20, 2024:** During my most recent visit, both children appeared happy and settled. Amari showed me a school project he was proud of. Destiny sang a song she had learned in pre-K. Both children referred to the Pattersons by their first names and appeared to feel safe and at home. The Pattersons confirmed their desire to provide a permanent home for both children through adoption.

## III. REVIEW OF CASE STATUS

7. I have reviewed the DSS case file and case manager Monica Vance's reports regarding the Respondent, Crystal Price. I note that Ms. Price has completed only 3 of 12 required IOP sessions, has not enrolled in parenting classes, has no stable housing, has tested positive for fentanyl on two occasions, and has missed multiple scheduled drug screens.

8. I note that the children's biological father, Brandon Price, voluntarily relinquished his parental rights on November 20, 2023.

**pp. 1-2**

## IV. ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATION

9. I have visited the children three times in the Patterson home. Both children are thriving — Amari is performing at grade level and Destiny has adjusted well to pre-K. The Pattersons provide a stable, loving home and wish to adopt. In my assessment, termination of parental rights and adoption is in the best interest of both children.

10. Children of this age require consistency, stability, and a sense of permanency. Both Amari and Destiny have experienced disruption and instability in their young lives. In the Patterson home, they have found the safety and nurturing they need to grow and develop. Further uncertainty about their permanency risks undermining the progress they have made.

11. I respectfully recommend that this Court:
    - Grant the Petition for Termination of Parental Rights of Crystal Price;
    - Authorize DSS to proceed with the adoption of Amari Price and Destiny Price by the Patterson family;
    - Enter such other and further orders as may be in the best interest of the children.

# GUARDIAN AD LITEM REPORT — UPDATED

---

**Filed:** April 12, 2024
**Before:** The Honorable Harold Wynn, Family Court Judge
**Hearing:** Probable Cause Hearing on Petition for Termination of Parental Rights
**Guardian ad Litem:** Thomas Reed

---

**Case No.:** 2024-DR-15-0341

**IN THE INTEREST OF:**
- **Amari Price**, DOB: September 28, 2017
- **Destiny Price**, DOB: May 14, 2019

Minor Children.

## I. PURPOSE OF THIS REPORT

**p. 1**

1. This updated report is submitted in advance of the probable cause hearing scheduled for this matter. Since my initial report filed February 8, 2024, I have continued to monitor the status of the minor children and have reviewed additional information provided by DSS and counsel.

2. I have conducted one additional visit with the children in the Patterson home on March 23, 2024.

## II. UPDATED VISIT AND OBSERVATIONS

3. **Visit 4 — March 23, 2024:** Both children continue to do well in the Patterson home. Amari is finishing first grade and his teacher reports he is meeting all academic benchmarks. He has made close friendships and is participating in a youth soccer program. Destiny is thriving in pre-kindergarten and is beginning to recognize letters and numbers. She is social and outgoing with her peers. Both children appear bonded with the Patterson family and refer to the home as "our house."

4. The Pattersons remain fully committed to adopting both children and have begun the adoption home study process with DSS.

## III. RESPONSE TO RESPONDENT'S RECENT EFFORTS

5. I am aware that counsel for Crystal Price has informed the Court that Ms. Price has recently re-enrolled in IOP sessions and has obtained temporary housing. I acknowledge these efforts and recognize that Ms. Price may genuinely desire to regain custody of her children.

6. However, I note that this re-engagement comes more than seven months after the children were removed and more than four months after Ms. Price last attended an IOP session. The children have now been in foster care for eight months.

**p. 2**

## IV. UPDATED ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATION

7. While I acknowledge Ms. Price's recent efforts, the children have now been in foster care for eight months. They are bonded with the Patterson family and are stable for the first time in their lives. Further delays in permanency are not in the children's best interest. I continue to recommend TPR.

8. The law recognizes that children's sense of time is fundamentally different from that of adults. For Amari, now six years old, and Destiny, now four years old, eight months represents a significant portion of their lives. The stability they have found in the Patterson home is not something that should be disrupted based on recent and untested compliance efforts.

9. I have carefully weighed the Respondent's recent re-engagement against the children's need for permanency. While I do not question Ms. Price's love for her children, love alone is insufficient to provide the safe, stable, and consistent home environment these children require and deserve.

10. I respectfully continue to recommend that this Court:
    - Find probable cause to proceed with the Petition for Termination of Parental Rights;
    - Set this matter for a final TPR hearing at the earliest available date;
    - Maintain the children in their current placement with the Patterson family pending final resolution.

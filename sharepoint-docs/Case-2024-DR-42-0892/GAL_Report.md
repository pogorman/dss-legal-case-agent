## I. INTRODUCTION AND APPOINTMENT

I, Karen Milford, was appointed Guardian ad Litem for Jaylen Webb on June 18, 2024, at the probable cause hearing held before this Court. I am a licensed attorney and a volunteer Guardian ad Litem with the South Carolina Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) program. I submit this report to the Court in advance of the thirty-day review hearing scheduled for July 18, 2024, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-11-530.

Since my appointment, I have conducted two home visits to the kinship placement, reviewed the DSS case file and associated records, spoken with the assigned case manager, reviewed medical records for the child, and interviewed relevant parties. This report reflects my independent assessment of Jaylen's best interests.

## II. BACKGROUND AND REMOVAL

Jaylen Webb, age three, was removed from the custody of his parents following his admission to Spartanburg Medical Center on June 12, 2024, with injuries consistent with non-accidental trauma. Medical evaluation revealed a bilateral femur fracture (right) and a spiral fracture of the left humerus. The attending physician, Dr. Anita Chowdhury, board-certified pediatrician, assessed the injuries as inconsistent with the reported mechanism of injury — a fall from a crib — and noted the fractures were at different stages of healing, indicating two separate injury events. Dr. Chowdhury filed a mandatory abuse/neglect report with DSS and the Spartanburg County Sheriff on June 12, 2024.

Both parents — Marcus Webb (father) and Dena Holloway (mother) — provided accounts of the injuries that were inconsistent with one another and inconsistent with the medical evidence. Both initially stated that Jaylen fell from his crib. However, Ms. Holloway later revised her account to law enforcement, disclosing that she heard a loud thump from Jaylen's room at approximately 9:30 PM on June 11, that Mr. Webb was in or near the room at that time, and that she has observed Mr. Webb grab Jaylen roughly by the arm on prior occasions. Mr. Webb denies being in the child's room after putting him to bed and denies any rough handling. These inconsistencies are a significant concern and underscore the need for continued investigation and protective intervention.

DSS filed an emergency removal petition on June 14, 2024. Family Court Judge Margaret Easley granted the ex parte emergency removal order and placed Jaylen in temporary DSS custody. A probable cause hearing was held on June 18, 2024, at which the Court found probable cause to believe the child was abused or neglected and continued the child in DSS custody.

## III. CURRENT PLACEMENT

Following his discharge from Spartanburg Regional Medical Center on June 20, 2024, Jaylen was placed in the kinship care of his maternal grandmother, Theresa Holloway, at 88 Creekside Ln, Greenville, SC. The placement was approved by DSS following completion of a home study and execution of a Kinship Foster Care Placement Agreement (DSS Form 1234).

I conducted home visits to the Holloway residence on June 28, 2024 and July 10, 2024. On both occasions, I found the home to be clean, safe, well-organized, and appropriate for a young child. Ms. Holloway is a retired educator who is attentive, patient, and warm in her interactions with Jaylen. She has established a daily routine for the child that includes structured play, meals at regular times, and a consistent bedtime.

Jaylen appeared comfortable and at ease in his grandmother's care. During my July 10 visit, he was engaged in play, responsive to Ms. Holloway's direction, and showed no signs of distress or fear. He referred to Ms. Holloway as "Nana" and sought her out for comfort when he became tired. Ms. Holloway reported that Jaylen had some difficulty sleeping during the first week of placement but that his sleep has since stabilized.

Ms. Holloway is cooperative with DSS requirements and has facilitated all scheduled supervised visitation between Jaylen and his parents. She has also ensured the child attends a follow-up medical appointment for his healing fracture. She expressed her commitment to caring for Jaylen for as long as needed and stated she would support reunification if DSS and the Court determine it is safe to do so.

It is my assessment that Jaylen is safe, well-cared-for, and appropriately bonded with his grandmother. The current kinship placement is meeting the child's physical, emotional, and developmental needs.

## IV. REVIEW OF MEDICAL EVIDENCE

I reviewed the medical records from Spartanburg Medical Center, including the emergency department records from June 12, 2024, the radiology report, and the physician assessment prepared by Dr. Anita Chowdhury.

The medical evidence is clear and deeply concerning. The spiral fracture of the left humerus indicates torsional force, and the bilateral femur fracture is inconsistent with a fall from a standard crib height. Critically, Dr. Chowdhury's radiographic findings indicate that the femur fracture is approximately 24-48 hours older than the humerus fracture, confirming at least two separate trauma events occurring days apart. In Dr. Chowdhury's medical opinion, "these injuries are non-accidental. A three-year-old falling from a crib would not sustain bilateral long bone fractures of this nature."

This medical evidence, taken together with the parents' inconsistent and contradictory accounts, raises serious concerns about Jaylen's safety in his parents' care.

## V. PARENTS' INCONSISTENT ACCOUNTS

As detailed in the DSS Dictation PDF and Sheriff Report #24-06-4418, the parents have provided conflicting and evolving accounts of the events of June 11-12, 2024.

Mr. Webb states he put Jaylen to bed at 10:00 PM, fell asleep on the couch, and was unaware of any problem until Ms. Holloway woke him at 2:00 AM. He denies re-entering the child's room and suggests the child may have fallen while climbing out of the crib.

Ms. Holloway initially corroborated this account at the hospital. However, during a subsequent interview with Lt. Frank Odom of the Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office on June 13, she revised her statement. She disclosed that she heard a loud thump from Jaylen's room at approximately 9:30 PM, that Mr. Webb was in or near the room at that time, and that Mr. Webb has a temper and she has seen him grab Jaylen roughly by the arm "two or three times" in the past.

The inconsistency between the parents' accounts — and the significant revision of Ms. Holloway's initial statement — is deeply troubling. The medical evidence of two separate injury events occurring days apart contradicts both parents' accounts of a single incident on the night of June 11. Until the investigation can determine the circumstances surrounding these injuries with greater clarity, I believe it would be unsafe to return Jaylen to either parent's care.

## VI. CASE PLAN AND SERVICES

DSS has developed a case plan for the family that includes the following components:

- **Parenting Classes:** Both parents are required to complete an approved parenting education program. As of the date of this report, neither parent has enrolled.
- **Psychological Evaluations:** Both parents are required to complete comprehensive psychological evaluations with a licensed provider approved by DSS. These evaluations are intended to assess each parent's mental health, parenting capacity, and any risk factors for future abuse. Evaluations have been scheduled but have not yet been completed.
- **Supervised Visitation:** Visitation between Jaylen and his parents has been set at twice weekly, supervised by DSS. Ms. Holloway has facilitated transportation for all visits. The case manager, Renee Dawson, reports that visitation has occurred as scheduled and has been generally appropriate, though the mother was noted to be emotionally distressed during the first visit.
- **Cooperation with Investigation:** Both parents are expected to cooperate fully with the ongoing DSS investigation and any law enforcement investigation.

I am encouraged that supervised visitation is occurring regularly, but I am concerned that neither parent has yet enrolled in parenting classes or completed the required psychological evaluations. Timely compliance with the case plan is essential, and I urge the Court to emphasize to the parents the importance of prompt engagement with the required services.

## VII. RECOMMENDATION

Based on my review of the records, my home visits, my conversations with the case manager and the caregiver, and my assessment of Jaylen's current well-being, I respectfully make the following recommendations to the Court:

1. **Jaylen should remain in the kinship care of Theresa Holloway.** The placement is safe, stable, and meeting the child's needs. Jaylen is thriving in his grandmother's care, and disrupting this placement would not be in his best interest.

2. **Jaylen should not be returned to either parent's custody at this time.** The medical evidence of non-accidental trauma, combined with the parents' inconsistent accounts, presents an unacceptable risk to the child's safety. Reunification should not be considered until the investigation is complete, both parents have complied with the case plan, and DSS is satisfied that the risk of harm has been adequately addressed.

3. **The parents should be ordered to enroll in parenting classes and complete psychological evaluations within 30 days.** Continued delay in engaging with required services should be considered by the Court in any future determination regarding reunification.

4. **Supervised visitation should continue** at the current frequency and under the current conditions.

5. **The matter should proceed to a merits hearing as scheduled on September 12, 2024**, at which time the Court can hear the full evidence regarding the allegations of abuse and make a determination on the merits of the case.

I will continue to advocate for Jaylen's best interests and will provide updated reports to the Court as proceedings continue.

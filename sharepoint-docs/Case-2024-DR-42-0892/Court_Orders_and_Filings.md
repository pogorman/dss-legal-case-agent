### EX PARTE ORDER FOR EMERGENCY PROTECTIVE CUSTODY

**Court Filing #2024-DR-42-0892, Order 1**

This matter comes before the Court on June 14, 2024, at 10:00 AM, upon the Petition for Emergency Protective Custody filed by the South Carolina Department of Social Services ("DSS"). The Court, having reviewed the Petition, the supporting Affidavit of DSS Case Manager Renee Dawson, the attached medical records from Spartanburg Medical Center, and the Spartanburg County Sheriff Report #24-06-4418, and being fully advised in the premises, hereby makes the following findings and order:

### FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Jaylen Webb (DOB: April 10, 2021) is a three-year-old minor child residing at 412 Oak Hollow Rd, Spartanburg, South Carolina, with his parents, Marcus Webb (DOB: March 15, 1991) and Dena Holloway (DOB: August 22, 1993).

2. On June 12, 2024, at approximately 3:15 AM, the minor child was presented to the Emergency Department of Spartanburg Medical Center by both parents. (Medical Records, pp. 1-4.)

3. Upon examination and diagnostic imaging, the attending physician, Dr. Anita Chowdhury, a board-certified pediatrician, diagnosed the minor child with a bilateral femur fracture (right leg) and a spiral fracture of the left humerus. (Medical Records, pp. 1-4.)

4. Dr. Chowdhury determined that the injuries are inconsistent with the reported mechanism of injury, namely a fall from a crib. The spiral fracture of the left humerus indicates torsional force. Radiographic findings further indicate that the femur fracture is approximately 24 to 48 hours older than the humerus fracture, indicating two separate injury events occurring at different times. (Medical Records, p. 5.)

5. On June 12, 2024, at approximately 7:30 AM, Dr. Chowdhury filed a mandatory report of suspected abuse or neglect with DSS and the Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-7-310. (Medical Records, p. 5; DSS Intake Report.)

6. On June 12, 2024, at approximately 11:00 AM, Lt. Frank Odom of the Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office responded to Spartanburg Medical Center, observed the child's injuries, and initiated an investigation. (Sheriff Report #24-06-4418, p. 1.)

7. On June 13, 2024, DSS Case Manager Renee Dawson conducted an initial assessment interview with Dena Holloway at Spartanburg Medical Center. Ms. Holloway stated that the child fell from his crib and that Marcus Webb was the only adult present with the child after bedtime. (Dictation PDF, pp. 4-6.)

8. On June 13, 2024, Lt. Odom separately interviewed both parents. Marcus Webb stated he was asleep on the couch and did not enter the child's room after putting the child to bed at approximately 10:00 PM on June 11, 2024. He denied knowledge of how the injuries occurred. (Sheriff Report #24-06-4418, pp. 3-5.)

9. During her interview with Lt. Odom on the afternoon of June 13, 2024, Dena Holloway materially changed her account. Ms. Holloway disclosed that she heard a loud thump from the child's room at approximately 9:30 PM on June 11, 2024, that Marcus Webb was in or near the child's room at that time, and that she called out to Mr. Webb, who responded that everything was fine. Ms. Holloway further stated that Mr. Webb has a temper, becomes frustrated when the child cries, and that she has witnessed Mr. Webb grab the child roughly by the arm on approximately two to three prior occasions. (Sheriff Report #24-06-4418, pp. 6-8.)

10. The parents have provided conflicting and inconsistent accounts of the events surrounding the child's injuries. The medical evidence contradicts both parents' accounts of a single accidental fall.

11. DSS Case Manager Renee Dawson avers that, based on her assessment, the child is at imminent risk of harm if returned to either parent at this time. The medical evidence indicates non-accidental trauma and both parents have provided inconsistent accounts. Ms. Dawson recommends emergency removal and kinship placement with the maternal grandmother. (Dictation PDF, p. 15.)

### CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-7-620 and Section 63-7-710.

2. DSS has demonstrated that the minor child, Jaylen Webb, is in imminent danger of being harmed and that removal from the home is necessary to protect the child's health, safety, and welfare.

3. Reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the need for removal from the home are not required where the Court finds that the child is in imminent danger, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-7-620(B).

4. An emergency hearing without prior notice to the Respondents is justified because the circumstances present an imminent threat to the child's safety and any delay occasioned by prior notice could result in further harm to the child.

### IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED:

1. The minor child, Jaylen Webb (DOB: April 10, 2021), is hereby placed in the emergency protective custody of the South Carolina Department of Social Services effective immediately.

2. DSS shall have the authority to determine the appropriate placement of the child, including but not limited to kinship care, foster care, or other suitable arrangement.

3. A Probable Cause Hearing shall be held within seventy-two (72) hours of this Order, exclusive of weekends and holidays, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-7-710.

4. The Respondents, Marcus Webb and Dena Holloway, shall be served with a copy of the Petition and this Order and shall be advised of their right to counsel.

5. This Order shall remain in effect until further order of this Court.

SO ORDERED this 14th day of June, 2024.

## ORDER 2 — PROBABLE CAUSE HEARING

---

### STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA
### IN THE FAMILY COURT
### SEVENTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT
### SPARTANBURG COUNTY

---

**Case No.:** 2024-DR-42-0892

**THE SOUTH CAROLINA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES,**
Plaintiff,

v.

**MARCUS WEBB and DENA HOLLOWAY,**
Respondents.

**IN THE INTEREST OF:**
Jaylen Webb, a minor child, DOB: April 10, 2021

### ORDER FOLLOWING PROBABLE CAUSE HEARING

**Court Filing #2024-DR-42-0892, Order 2**

This matter came before the Court on June 18, 2024, at 9:30 AM, for a Probable Cause Hearing pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-7-710. Present before the Court were:

- **For the Plaintiff:** Counsel for the South Carolina Department of Social Services; Renee Dawson, DSS Case Manager
- **For the Respondent Marcus Webb:** Court-appointed counsel
- **For the Respondent Dena Holloway:** Court-appointed counsel
- **Witness for Plaintiff:** Dr. Anita Chowdhury, M.D., Attending Pediatrician, Spartanburg Medical Center

The Court received testimony, reviewed documentary evidence including medical records from Spartanburg Medical Center, Spartanburg County Sheriff Report #24-06-4418, the DSS Dictation PDF, and the DSS Intake Report, and considered the arguments of counsel. The Court hereby makes the following findings and order:

### FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On June 14, 2024, this Court issued an Ex Parte Emergency Removal Order placing the minor child, Jaylen Webb (DOB: April 10, 2021), in the emergency protective custody of DSS based on evidence of non-accidental injuries.

2. The Respondents, Marcus Webb and Dena Holloway, were duly served with the Petition and the Emergency Removal Order. Both Respondents appeared before the Court with appointed counsel.

3. Dr. Anita Chowdhury, a board-certified pediatrician and the attending physician who examined Jaylen Webb upon his admission to Spartanburg Medical Center on June 12, 2024, testified under oath. Dr. Chowdhury's testimony is summarized as follows:

   > "In my medical opinion, these injuries are non-accidental. A three-year-old falling from a crib would not sustain bilateral long bone fractures of this nature. The different healing stages confirm at least two separate trauma events occurring days apart."

   *(Court Transcript, Probable Cause Hearing, p. 14.)*

4. Dr. Chowdhury further testified that the spiral fracture of the left humerus indicates torsional force and that the femur fracture is approximately 24 to 48 hours older than the humerus fracture, conclusively establishing that the injuries could not have resulted from a single incident. (Medical Records, p. 5; Court Transcript, Probable Cause Hearing, p. 14.)

5. The Court received evidence that Marcus Webb stated to medical staff on June 12, 2024, that he put the child to bed at approximately 10:00 PM on June 11, 2024, and that the child was behaving normally throughout the day. Mr. Webb stated to Lt. Odom on June 13, 2024, that he was on the couch all night, did not enter the child's room after putting the child to bed, and does not know how the child was injured. (Medical Records, Nursing Notes, p. 8; Sheriff Report #24-06-4418, pp. 4-5.)

6. The Court received evidence that Dena Holloway initially stated to medical staff on June 12, 2024, that she heard the child crying at approximately 2:00 AM and believed the child fell from his crib. However, in her subsequent interview with Lt. Odom on the afternoon of June 13, 2024, Ms. Holloway materially revised her account, disclosing that she heard a loud thump from the child's room at approximately 9:30 PM on June 11, 2024, that Mr. Webb was in or near the child's room, and that she has witnessed Mr. Webb grab the child roughly by the arm on two to three prior occasions. (Medical Records, Nursing Notes, p. 9; Sheriff Report #24-06-4418, pp. 6-8.)

7. The accounts provided by the Respondents are materially inconsistent with each other and with the medical evidence. The medical evidence establishes that the child's injuries are non-accidental and occurred at two separate times, contradicting both parents' accounts of a single fall event.

8. If the thump heard by Ms. Holloway at 9:30 PM on June 11, 2024, was associated with an injury event, there was an approximately four-and-one-half-hour delay before the child was presented for medical treatment at 2:00 AM on June 12, 2024. Medical staff have noted this delay is of clinical concern. (Medical Records, Nursing Notes, p. 9; Sheriff Report #24-06-4418.)

9. DSS Case Manager Renee Dawson testified that the child remains at imminent risk of harm if returned to either parent at this time and recommended continued DSS custody with kinship placement with the maternal grandmother, Theresa Holloway, of 88 Creekside Ln, Greenville, South Carolina, pending completion of a home study. (Dictation PDF, p. 15.)

### CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-7-710.

2. The Court finds that probable cause exists to believe that the minor child, Jaylen Webb, has been abused or neglected, and that continued removal from the custody of the Respondents is necessary to protect the child's health, safety, and welfare.

3. The evidence presented, including uncontroverted medical testimony that the child's injuries are non-accidental and occurred at multiple times, inconsistent parental accounts, and evidence of prior rough handling of the child, is sufficient to support a finding of probable cause.

4. Reasonable efforts to prevent removal were not required prior to the emergency removal given the imminent danger to the child, and the Court finds that reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the need for continued removal are not feasible at this time.

### IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED:

1. The Court finds probable cause exists for the continued removal of the minor child, Jaylen Webb (DOB: April 10, 2021), from the custody of the Respondents, Marcus Webb and Dena Holloway.

2. The minor child shall remain in the legal custody of the South Carolina Department of Social Services pending further order of this Court.

3. DSS shall evaluate the home of the maternal grandmother, Theresa Holloway (DOB: November 5, 1962), located at 88 Creekside Ln, Greenville, South Carolina, for kinship foster care placement. Upon approval of the home study, DSS is authorized to place the child with Ms. Holloway under a kinship foster care agreement.

4. **Karen Milford** is hereby appointed as Guardian ad Litem for the minor child, Jaylen Webb, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-7-1620. Ms. Milford, an attorney and volunteer Guardian ad Litem with the South Carolina Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) program, shall represent the best interests of the child in all proceedings related to this matter and shall have access to all records and documents pertaining to the child's case.

5. Neither Respondent shall have unsupervised contact with the minor child pending further order of this Court. Any visitation shall be supervised by DSS or its designee.

6. A Thirty-Day Review Hearing is hereby scheduled for **July 18, 2024, at 2:00 PM** before this Court.

7. DSS shall prepare and file a proposed case plan for the Respondents no later than ten (10) days prior to the Thirty-Day Review Hearing.

8. This Order shall remain in effect until further order of this Court.

SO ORDERED this 18th day of June, 2024.

### ORDER FOLLOWING THIRTY-DAY REVIEW HEARING

**Court Filing #2024-DR-42-0892, Order 3**

This matter came before the Court on July 18, 2024, at 2:00 PM, for a Thirty-Day Review Hearing pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-7-1660. Present before the Court were:

- **For the Plaintiff:** Counsel for the South Carolina Department of Social Services; Renee Dawson, DSS Case Manager
- **For the Respondent Marcus Webb:** Court-appointed counsel; Marcus Webb, in person
- **For the Respondent Dena Holloway:** Court-appointed counsel; Dena Holloway, in person
- **Guardian ad Litem:** Karen Milford, GAL for the minor child Jaylen Webb

The Court received testimony from the parties and DSS, reviewed the proposed case plan filed by DSS, received a report from the Guardian ad Litem, and considered the arguments of counsel. The Court hereby makes the following findings and order:

### FINDINGS OF FACT

1. By Order of this Court dated June 14, 2024, the minor child, Jaylen Webb (DOB: April 10, 2021), was placed in the emergency protective custody of DSS. By Order dated June 18, 2024, the Court found probable cause for the continued removal of the child from the custody of the Respondents.

2. On June 20, 2024, the minor child was discharged from Spartanburg Medical Center and placed with his maternal grandmother, Theresa Holloway (DOB: November 5, 1962), at 88 Creekside Ln, Greenville, South Carolina, under a kinship foster care agreement approved by DSS following completion of a satisfactory home study. (Placement Agreement, DSS Form 1234; Home Study Report, p. 2.)

3. DSS Case Manager Renee Dawson reported that the home study of Ms. Theresa Holloway's residence was completed on June 20, 2024. The home was found to be clean, safe, and age-appropriate for a three-year-old child. Ms. Holloway is cooperative and understands the placement requirements. The child is currently in a safe and appropriate placement. (Home Study Report, p. 2.)

4. DSS has prepared and filed a proposed case plan for both Respondents. The case plan requires the following:

   a. **Parenting Classes:** Both Respondents shall enroll in and successfully complete an approved parenting education program.

   b. **Psychological Evaluations:** Both Respondents shall submit to comprehensive psychological evaluations by a licensed mental health professional approved by DSS.

   c. **Supervised Visitation:** Both Respondents shall be permitted supervised visitation with the minor child, to be arranged and supervised by DSS or its designee, at such times and under such conditions as DSS deems appropriate.

   d. **Cooperation with Investigation:** Both Respondents shall fully cooperate with the ongoing investigation by the Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office and DSS.

   e. **No Unsupervised Contact:** Neither Respondent shall have unsupervised contact with the minor child.

5. Marcus Webb appeared before the Court and testified as follows:

   > "I have enrolled in parenting classes at Spartanburg Family Services. I want to get my son back. I am willing to do everything in the case plan."

   *(Court Transcript, 30-Day Review, p. 22.)*

6. Dena Holloway appeared before the Court and expressed her willingness to comply with the case plan. Ms. Holloway stated that she supports the kinship placement with her mother, Theresa Holloway, and that she wants what is best for Jaylen.

7. Guardian ad Litem Karen Milford filed a report with the Court and recommended that the minor child remain in kinship foster care with the maternal grandmother. Ms. Milford reported that the child appears to be adjusting well to the placement and that the maternal grandmother is providing appropriate care.

8. The Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office investigation remains open and ongoing. No criminal charges have been filed at this time.

9. The Court notes that the medical evidence established at the Probable Cause Hearing — including the testimony of Dr. Anita Chowdhury that the child's injuries were non-accidental, involved at least two separate trauma events occurring days apart, and were inconsistent with a fall from a crib (Court Transcript, Probable Cause Hearing, p. 14; Medical Records, pp. 1-5) — continues to raise serious concerns regarding the safety of the child in the custody of either Respondent.

10. The Court further notes the significant discrepancies between the Respondents' accounts as documented in the Sheriff Report #24-06-4418, including but not limited to: (a) Mr. Webb's denial that he entered the child's room after 10:00 PM versus Ms. Holloway's statement that she heard a thump from the child's room at 9:30 PM and Mr. Webb indicated everything was fine; (b) Mr. Webb's denial of any rough handling of the child versus Ms. Holloway's statement that she has witnessed Mr. Webb grab the child roughly by the arm on two to three prior occasions; and (c) the inconsistency between both parents' accounts of a single fall event and the medical evidence of two separate injury events.

### CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-7-1660.

2. The Court finds that the minor child's continued removal from the custody of the Respondents is necessary to protect the child's health, safety, and welfare.

3. The case plan proposed by DSS is reasonable, appropriate, and directed toward remedying the conditions that necessitated the child's removal.

4. The kinship placement with the maternal grandmother, Theresa Holloway, is appropriate and in the best interest of the minor child.

5. Both Respondents have expressed willingness to cooperate with the case plan. The Court will monitor compliance through subsequent review hearings.

### IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED:

1. The minor child, Jaylen Webb (DOB: April 10, 2021), shall remain in the legal custody of the South Carolina Department of Social Services and shall continue in kinship foster care placement with his maternal grandmother, Theresa Holloway, at 88 Creekside Ln, Greenville, South Carolina.

2. The Court hereby approves the DSS Case Plan, a copy of which is attached hereto and incorporated by reference, requiring both Respondents to complete the following:

   a. **Parenting Classes:** Both Marcus Webb and Dena Holloway shall enroll in and successfully complete an approved parenting education program within ninety (90) days. Mr. Webb has represented to the Court that he has already enrolled in parenting classes at Spartanburg Family Services.

   b. **Psychological Evaluations:** Both Marcus Webb and Dena Holloway shall submit to comprehensive psychological evaluations conducted by a licensed mental health professional approved by DSS. Evaluations shall be completed within sixty (60) days.

   c. **Supervised Visitation:** Both Respondents shall be entitled to supervised visitation with the minor child at such times and frequency as determined appropriate by DSS. All visitation shall be supervised by DSS or its designee. DSS shall facilitate visitation on at least a biweekly basis absent safety concerns.

   d. **Full Cooperation:** Both Respondents shall fully cooperate with the Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office investigation and with all DSS case management activities, including but not limited to home visits, interviews, and assessments.

   e. **No Unsupervised Contact:** Neither Respondent shall have any unsupervised contact with the minor child until further order of this Court.

3. DSS shall file a status report with the Court no later than ten (10) days prior to the next scheduled hearing, detailing the Respondents' compliance with the case plan, the child's status in placement, and DSS's recommendations.

4. Guardian ad Litem Karen Milford shall continue to serve as GAL for the minor child and shall file an updated report with the Court prior to the next scheduled hearing.

5. A **Merits Hearing** is hereby scheduled for **September 12, 2024**, before this Court. The purpose of the merits hearing shall be to determine whether the allegations in the Petition are established by a preponderance of the evidence and to determine the appropriate disposition of this matter.

6. This Order shall remain in effect until further order of this Court.

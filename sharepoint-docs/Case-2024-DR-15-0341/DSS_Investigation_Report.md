## I. Intake and Referral

On August 5, 2023, at approximately 3:00 PM, the Richland County Department of Social Services received a referral from Longleaf Elementary School regarding a seven-year-old male child, Amari Price (DOB: September 28, 2017), a second-grade student. The referral was assigned DSS Intake Report Number 23-08-1102. The reporting party was Amari's classroom teacher, who stated that the child had come to school hungry on multiple occasions, was wearing dirty clothes, and had disclosed to the teacher that his mother "sleeps all day" and that there was "no food at home." The teacher reported that these concerns had been escalating over the preceding weeks and that the child appeared increasingly withdrawn and fatigued during class.

A records check on the family revealed two prior DSS investigations involving the mother, Crystal Price (DOB: December 3, 1989), in 2021 and 2022. Both prior investigations were closed as unsubstantiated. The children named in those prior referrals were the same two minor children at issue in this case: Amari Price and his younger sister, Destiny Price (DOB: May 14, 2019), age five, enrolled in pre-K at Longleaf Elementary.

The children's father is Brandon Price (DOB: June 19, 1987). A records check confirmed that Mr. Price has been incarcerated at Kirkland Correctional Institution since March 2023. He was not residing in the home at the time of the referral.

## II. Home Visit and Assessment

On August 8, 2023, at approximately 10:00 AM, I, Monica Vance, Case Manager with Richland County DSS, conducted an unannounced home visit at the family's residence at 1547 Gervais Street, Apartment 4B, Columbia, South Carolina. The purpose of the visit was to assess the living conditions and welfare of the two minor children, Amari Price and Destiny Price.

Upon entering the apartment, I observed drug paraphernalia on the kitchen counter including a burnt spoon and syringe. The refrigerator contained only condiments and a gallon of spoiled milk. The apartment was in an overall unsanitary condition. There was spoiled food on the kitchen countertops, and a strong odor throughout the unit. I confirmed with the utility company that water service to the apartment had been disconnected on July 28, 2023, for nonpayment. There was no running water in the home at the time of my visit.

Both children were present in the apartment and were in the living room watching television. Neither child was under direct adult supervision when I arrived. Amari told me he was hungry. I observed that both children were wearing soiled clothing. Destiny appeared to have not been bathed recently. The children's bedroom contained a mattress on the floor with no sheets and limited clothing.

Crystal Price was present in the apartment. She appeared impaired at the time of my visit -- her speech was slurred, her eyes were glassy, and she was slow to respond to questions. When I identified myself as a DSS case manager and explained the purpose of my visit, Ms. Price became defensive but did not refuse entry. She stated: "I'm going through a hard time. Brandon is locked up and I lost my job. The kids are fine, I take care of them. I just need some help with the bills."

--- Page 3 ---

I informed Ms. Price that the conditions I observed in the home, including the presence of drug paraphernalia, the lack of food, the absence of running water, and the children's overall condition, constituted grounds for serious concern regarding the safety and welfare of both children. I asked Ms. Price directly about the paraphernalia on the counter. She did not deny that it belonged to her but stated that she "has it under control" and that the children "don't go in the kitchen." I noted that the kitchen was not separated from the living area by any door or barrier and that the paraphernalia was within easy reach of a child.

I attempted to discuss Ms. Price's substance use history in more detail, but she became increasingly agitated and asked me to leave. I informed her that given the conditions observed, I would be contacting my supervisor and the court regarding emergency removal.

## III. Emergency Removal

On August 8, 2023, at approximately 4:00 PM, the Richland County Department of Social Services obtained an emergency removal order from the Fifth Judicial Circuit Family Court. Both children, Amari Price and Destiny Price, were removed from the custody of Crystal Price and placed in emergency foster care. Ms. Price was present at the time of removal and was informed of her rights, including the right to counsel, the right to a probable cause hearing, and the process for seeking reunification. Ms. Price was visibly upset but did not physically resist the removal. She told the children she would "get them back soon."

## IV. Court Proceedings and Treatment Plan

### A. Probable Cause Hearing -- August 15, 2023

On August 15, 2023, at 9:00 AM, a probable cause hearing was held before Judge Harold Wynn of the Fifth Judicial Circuit Family Court. The court found probable cause of neglect. Crystal Price was present with appointed counsel. I presented my findings from the home visit, including photographs of the apartment conditions, the drug paraphernalia, and the utility shutoff confirmation.

The court ordered a treatment plan for Ms. Price as a condition of reunification, requiring the following: (1) completion of a substance abuse evaluation, (2) completion of an intensive outpatient program as recommended by the evaluator, (3) enrollment in and completion of parenting classes, (4) establishment of stable housing appropriate for two children, and (5) maintenance of employment or a verifiable income source. The court ordered random drug screening and set a reunification review hearing for ninety days.

### B. Substance Abuse Evaluation -- September 10, 2023

On September 10, 2023, Dr. Raymond Ellis, a licensed clinical social worker and substance abuse evaluator, conducted a formal substance abuse evaluation of Crystal Price. Dr. Ellis diagnosed Ms. Price with Opioid Use Disorder, moderate severity. According to his evaluation report, Ms. Price reported daily opioid use beginning in 2021 following a back injury. She had not previously sought treatment for substance abuse. Dr. Ellis recommended intensive outpatient treatment consisting of a minimum of twelve sessions, combined with random drug screening and participation in Narcotics Anonymous or a similar peer support program.

### C. Foster Care Placement -- September 25, 2023

On September 25, 2023, following the completion of required background checks and a home study, Amari and Destiny Price were placed with Sandra Patterson, a licensed foster parent in Richland County. Mrs. Patterson has been a licensed foster parent since 2019. Both children were enrolled at Longleaf Elementary School near the Patterson home. Amari was placed in second grade and Destiny was enrolled in pre-K. Mrs. Patterson and her family expressed interest in adoption if reunification efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.

### D. Father's Voluntary Relinquishment -- November 20, 2023

On November 20, 2023, Brandon Price voluntarily relinquished his parental rights via a written consent filed with the court. Mr. Price submitted the filing from Kirkland Correctional Institution. In his statement, Mr. Price indicated that he wanted what was best for the children and acknowledged that he could not parent from incarceration. Judge Wynn accepted the voluntary relinquishment. Mr. Price's parental rights were formally terminated as of that date. He is no longer a party to this proceeding.

## V. Case Progress and Compliance Review

### A. Ninety-Day Review Hearing -- November 14, 2023

On November 14, 2023, the court held a ninety-day review hearing before Judge Harold Wynn. At that time, Ms. Price had attended only three of the twelve required intensive outpatient program sessions. She had not enrolled in parenting classes as ordered. She did not have stable housing and reported to me that she had been staying with various friends at different locations throughout Richland County. I attempted six home visits during this period and was able to make contact with Ms. Price on only two occasions.

Ms. Price had two positive drug screens for fentanyl, dated October 8 and October 22, 2023. These results were submitted to the court. Ms. Price stated at the hearing: "I have been trying to get to the IOP sessions but I don't have reliable transportation. I missed some appointments. I am looking for housing but it is hard without income. I am clean now." The positive drug screens from October directly contradicted Ms. Price's claim of current sobriety.

The court continued the treatment plan and issued a formal warning to Ms. Price that failure to substantially comply with the court-ordered requirements could result in the filing of a petition for termination of parental rights.

### B. Ongoing Case Management -- November 2023 through January 2024

Between the ninety-day review and the filing of the TPR petition, I continued to monitor Ms. Price's progress. During this period, DSS provided the following supportive services to Ms. Price:

- **Transportation:** Monthly bus passes were issued to Ms. Price to address her stated transportation barriers. IOP transportation assistance was also offered through the treatment facility, but Ms. Price declined this service.
- **Housing:** Three housing referrals were provided, including contact information and application assistance for subsidized housing programs in Richland County. I personally assisted Ms. Price in completing two housing applications.
- **Referrals:** Additional referrals were provided for employment assistance, food bank services, and community support programs.

Despite these supports, Ms. Price's compliance remained minimal. She missed scheduled drug screens on December 5, 2023, January 15, 2024, and March 3, 2024. She did not enroll in parenting classes. Her IOP attendance remained at three of twelve sessions through January 2024. She continued to lack stable housing, reporting to me that she had moved at least four times since the children's removal.

--- Page 8 ---

On February 8, 2024, shortly before the filing of the TPR petition, I spoke with Ms. Price by telephone. She was aware that the Department was preparing to file for termination. She stated: "I know I messed up but I am getting better. I started going to NA meetings. I found a room to rent. I just need more time. Six months is not enough when you have nothing."

I acknowledge that Ms. Price expressed genuine distress during this conversation and that she appeared to understand the gravity of the situation. However, the record demonstrates that over the six months since removal, Ms. Price received consistent outreach, supportive services, and clear guidance regarding the requirements for reunification. Her compliance has been insufficient by any objective measure.

## VI. Children's Status in Foster Care

Both children have adjusted well in the Patterson foster home. I have conducted monthly visits to the placement and have observed the following:

Amari Price is performing at grade level in second grade at Longleaf Elementary. His teacher reports that his attendance has been consistent, his hygiene has improved markedly since placement, and he is engaged in classroom activities. He has made friends and participates in the school's after-school program.

Destiny Price has adjusted well to pre-K at Longleaf Elementary. She initially exhibited some separation anxiety and difficulty sleeping, which are developmentally appropriate responses to removal. These behaviors have diminished significantly over time. Her pre-K teacher reports that she is social, curious, and meeting developmental milestones.

--- Page 9 ---

Sandra Patterson has provided a stable, nurturing environment for both children. Her home has passed all required inspections. She has facilitated all scheduled visitation between the children and their mother, maintained communication with the school, and ensured the children attend all medical and dental appointments. Mrs. Patterson has expressed her intent to adopt both children if the termination of parental rights is granted.

Thomas Reed, the court-appointed Guardian ad Litem, has visited the children three times in the Patterson home. In his report filed with the court, Mr. Reed stated: "Both children are thriving -- Amari is performing at grade level and Destiny has adjusted well to pre-K. The Pattersons provide a stable, loving home and wish to adopt. In my assessment, termination of parental rights and adoption is in the best interest of both children."

## VII. Grounds for Termination of Parental Rights

On February 8, 2024, at 10:00 AM, the Richland County Department of Social Services filed a petition for Termination of Parental Rights against Crystal Price in the Fifth Judicial Circuit Family Court. The petition sets forth the following statutory grounds:

1. **Child Neglect (S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-7-2570(1)):** The children were removed from conditions constituting neglect, including an unsanitary home, absence of food, lack of running water, presence of drug paraphernalia accessible to the children, and the mother's apparent impairment while the children were in her care.

2. **Failure to Remedy (S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-7-2570(2)):** Ms. Price has failed to remedy the conditions that caused the removal of the children for a period exceeding six months despite a court-ordered treatment plan. Specifically, she has completed only three of twelve IOP sessions, has not completed parenting classes, has no stable housing, and has had multiple positive drug screens.

3. **Diagnosable Condition Unlikely to Change (S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-7-2570(4)):** Ms. Price has a diagnosed Opioid Use Disorder, moderate severity, and has demonstrated an inability or unwillingness to engage in the treatment necessary to render her capable of providing minimally adequate care.

## VIII. Affidavit Summary

In support of the TPR petition, I submitted a sworn affidavit to the court on February 8, 2024. The substance of the affidavit is as follows:

Over the six months since removal, Ms. Price has made minimal progress on her treatment plan. She has completed 3 of 12 IOP sessions, has not completed parenting classes, has no stable housing, and has had multiple positive drug screens. DSS has provided bus passes, referrals, and assistance with housing applications. Despite these supports, compliance has been insufficient.

I stated in the affidavit that the Department has made reasonable efforts to prevent the removal and to facilitate reunification, and that those efforts have been unsuccessful due to Ms. Price's failure to comply with the treatment plan. The Department's position is that the children's best interests are served by permanency through termination of parental rights and adoption.

## IX. Subsequent Proceedings -- TPR Probable Cause Hearing

On April 22, 2024, at 9:30 AM, a TPR probable cause hearing was held before Judge Harold Wynn. The court found probable cause to proceed to a merits hearing on the termination petition.

At the time of this hearing, Ms. Price had increased her engagement with services somewhat. She had completed five of twelve IOP sessions (up from three at the time of filing), enrolled in parenting classes and attended two of eight sessions, and obtained temporary housing -- a rented room in a shared house. Her most recent drug screen, dated April 10, 2024, was negative.

--- Page 11 ---

However, the court noted that while Ms. Price had made some progress, the progress remained insufficient given the eight-month timeframe since removal. The shared housing arrangement -- a single room of approximately ten feet by ten feet with a shared bathroom, rented on a month-to-month basis with no lease -- would not be appropriate housing for two children. The housing inspection confirmed these limitations.

Ms. Price stated at the hearing: "I have been going to my IOP sessions and parenting classes. I have a place to stay now. I am working part-time at a gas station. I am trying. I want my kids back."

The Guardian ad Litem, Thomas Reed, stated: "While I acknowledge Ms. Price's recent efforts, the children have now been in foster care for eight months. They are bonded with the Patterson family and are stable for the first time in their lives. Further delays in permanency are not in the children's best interest. I continue to recommend TPR."

The merits hearing has been scheduled for July 15, 2024.

## X. Recommendations

Based on the totality of the evidence gathered throughout this investigation and the six-month case management period, including home visit observations, drug screening results, treatment plan compliance records, court filings, and my professional assessment, I make the following recommendations:

1. **Termination of Parental Rights:** That the court grant the Department's petition for termination of Crystal Price's parental rights regarding both minor children, Amari Price and Destiny Price. The mother has failed to remedy the conditions causing removal despite reasonable efforts and supportive services provided by the Department over a period of more than six months.

2. **Permanency Plan -- Adoption:** That the permanency plan for both children be changed from reunification to adoption. The pre-adoptive placement with the Patterson family is stable, appropriate, and in the children's best interests.

3. **Continued Placement:** That Amari and Destiny Price remain in the custody of DSS and in their current foster care placement with Sandra Patterson pending the outcome of the merits hearing.

4. **Visitation:** That supervised visitation between Ms. Price and the children continue as ordered by the court, at the Department's discretion, pending the merits hearing.

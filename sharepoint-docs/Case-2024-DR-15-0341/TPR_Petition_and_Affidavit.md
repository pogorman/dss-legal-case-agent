# PETITION FOR TERMINATION OF PARENTAL RIGHTS

---

**Filed:** February 8, 2024
**Before:** The Honorable Harold Wynn, Family Court Judge

---

## I. PARTIES AND JURISDICTION

1. The Petitioner, the South Carolina Department of Social Services ("DSS"), is the state agency charged with the protection of children in the State of South Carolina pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-7-10 et seq.

2. The Respondent, Crystal Price, is the biological mother of the minor children Amari Price (DOB 9/28/2017) and Destiny Price (DOB 5/14/2019). Ms. Price is a resident of Richland County, South Carolina.

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-7-2570 and Section 63-3-530.

4. Venue is proper in Richland County, South Carolina, as the minor children were removed from a residence within this county.

## II. BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

5. On August 8, 2023, the minor children Amari Price and Destiny Price were removed from the home of their mother, Crystal Price, following a substantiated investigation of child neglect by DSS.

6. On August 10, 2023, this Court held an emergency removal hearing and granted DSS emergency protective custody of both children.

7. On September 12, 2023, a merits hearing was held. This Court found that the children were abused or neglected as defined by S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-7-20 and ordered the children to remain in DSS custody.

8. A treatment plan was ordered by the Court on September 12, 2023, requiring the Respondent to complete the following: (a) substance abuse evaluation and recommended treatment; (b) completion of an Intensive Outpatient Program ("IOP"); (c) parenting classes; (d) obtaining and maintaining stable housing; and (e) submitting to random drug screens.

9. The biological father, Brandon Price, voluntarily relinquished his parental rights to both children on November 20, 2023. His relinquishment was accepted by this Court.

10. The minor children have been placed in foster care with the Patterson family since their removal and have remained in that placement continuously.

## III. GROUNDS FOR TERMINATION

DSS respectfully petitions this Court to terminate the parental rights of Crystal Price pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-7-2570 on the following grounds:

### A. Child Neglect (S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-7-2570(1))

11. On August 8, 2023, DSS caseworker Patricia Holloway and case manager Monica Vance conducted a home visit at the residence of Crystal Price in response to a report of child neglect.

12. Upon arrival, the caseworker and case manager observed the following conditions:
    - The home was in an unsanitary condition;
    - There was no running water in the home due to a utility shutoff;
    - Drug paraphernalia was observed in the kitchen area, including a burnt spoon and a syringe;
    - Crystal Price appeared visibly impaired and was unable to respond coherently to questioning;
    - Both minor children, ages 5 and 4 at the time, were found unsupervised in the residence.

13. DSS had conducted two prior investigations of the Respondent's home in 2021 and 2022. Both prior investigations were unsubstantiated. The August 2023 investigation was substantiated for child neglect.

### B. Failure to Remedy Conditions Causing Removal (S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-7-2570(2))

14. More than six months have elapsed since the children were removed from the Respondent's care, and the Respondent has failed to remedy the conditions that caused the removal despite a court-ordered treatment plan.

15. As of the date of this filing, the Respondent's compliance with the court-ordered treatment plan is as follows:
    - **Substance Abuse Evaluation:** Completed on September 18, 2023, with Dr. Ellis. The Respondent was diagnosed with Opioid Use Disorder, moderate severity.
    - **Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP):** The Respondent has completed only 3 of 12 required IOP sessions.
    - **Parenting Classes:** The Respondent has not enrolled in parenting classes.
    - **Stable Housing:** The Respondent does not have stable housing. She has reported staying with various friends and has no permanent address.
    - **Drug Screens:** The Respondent tested positive for fentanyl on October 8, 2023 and October 22, 2023. The Respondent failed to appear for scheduled drug screens on December 5, 2023, January 15, 2024, and March 3, 2024.

### C. Substance Abuse Rendering Parent Unable to Provide Minimally Adequate Care (S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-7-2570(4))

16. The Respondent has a diagnosed Opioid Use Disorder of moderate severity that renders her unable to provide minimally adequate care for the minor children.

17. Despite being offered treatment and support services, the Respondent has failed to make meaningful progress in addressing her substance abuse. She has completed only 3 of 12 IOP sessions, has tested positive for fentanyl on two occasions, and has missed three scheduled drug screens.

18. The Respondent's continued substance abuse and lack of engagement with treatment demonstrate an inability to provide a safe and stable environment for the minor children.

## IV. REASONABLE EFFORTS BY DSS

19. DSS has made reasonable efforts to assist the Respondent in reunification with the minor children, including but not limited to:
    - Providing monthly bus passes to the Respondent to facilitate attendance at treatment sessions, court hearings, and visitation;
    - Providing three separate housing referrals and assistance with housing applications;
    - Offering transportation assistance for IOP sessions, which the Respondent declined;
    - Arranging and facilitating the substance abuse evaluation with Dr. Ellis;
    - Scheduling and arranging supervised visitation.

20. Despite the reasonable efforts of DSS, the Respondent has been unable or unwilling to comply with the court-ordered treatment plan in a manner sufficient to ensure the safety and welfare of the minor children.

## V. BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILDREN

21. Both minor children are thriving in their current foster placement with the Patterson family. Amari Price is performing at grade level in school. Destiny Price has adjusted well to pre-kindergarten.

22. The Patterson family has expressed their desire to adopt both children and provide them with a permanent, stable home.

23. The Court-appointed Guardian ad Litem, Thomas Reed, has recommended termination of parental rights and adoption by the Patterson family as being in the best interest of both children.

24. It is in the best interest of the minor children that the parental rights of Crystal Price be terminated so that the children may achieve permanency through adoption.

## VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the South Carolina Department of Social Services respectfully prays that this Honorable Court:

A. Terminate the parental rights of Crystal Price as to the minor children Amari Price (DOB 9/28/2017) and Destiny Price (DOB 5/14/2019);

B. Grant DSS authority to consent to the adoption of the minor children;

C. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,

**SOUTH CAROLINA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES**

# AFFIDAVIT OF MONICA VANCE IN SUPPORT OF PETITION FOR TERMINATION OF PARENTAL RIGHTS

---

**Case No.:** 2024-DR-15-0341

---

## STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA
## COUNTY OF RICHLAND

I, Monica Vance, being duly sworn, do hereby state under oath as follows:

**p. 1**

1. I am a Case Manager employed by the South Carolina Department of Social Services, Richland County Office. I have held this position for approximately four years. I am assigned to Case No. 2024-DR-15-0341 involving the minor children Amari Price and Destiny Price.

2. I have personal knowledge of the facts set forth in this affidavit based on my direct involvement in this case, my review of DSS records, and my interactions with the Respondent, Crystal Price, the minor children, and their foster family.

**p. 2**

3. On August 8, 2023, I accompanied DSS caseworker Patricia Holloway to the home of Crystal Price in Richland County in response to a report of child neglect. Upon entering the residence, I observed the following conditions:
    - The home was in an unsanitary state, with garbage, spoiled food, and soiled clothing throughout the living areas;
    - The kitchen and bathroom had no running water. Utility records confirmed the water service had been shut off for non-payment;
    - Drug paraphernalia was observed in the kitchen, specifically a burnt spoon on the counter and a syringe on the floor near the kitchen table;
    - Ms. Price was present in the home and appeared visibly impaired. Her speech was slurred, her pupils were constricted, and she was unable to stand without support;
    - Both children, Amari (then age 5) and Destiny (then age 4), were found in the living room. Neither child had been bathed recently, and Destiny was wearing a soiled diaper. There was no edible food in the home.

4. Based on these observations, I determined that the children were in immediate danger, and an emergency removal was initiated. The children were placed in the custody of DSS and subsequently placed with the Patterson foster family, where they have remained.

**p. 3**

5. DSS had previously investigated Crystal Price on two occasions. An investigation in 2021 and another in 2022 were both unsubstantiated. The August 2023 investigation was substantiated for child neglect.

6. Following the merits hearing on September 12, 2023, the Court ordered a treatment plan for Ms. Price. The plan required: (a) a substance abuse evaluation and compliance with all recommendations; (b) completion of a 12-session Intensive Outpatient Program; (c) completion of parenting classes; (d) obtaining and maintaining stable housing; and (e) submission to random drug screens.

7. Ms. Price completed a substance abuse evaluation with Dr. Ellis on September 18, 2023. Dr. Ellis diagnosed Ms. Price with Opioid Use Disorder, moderate severity, and recommended completion of the IOP program and ongoing substance abuse treatment.

8. As of the date of this affidavit, Ms. Price has completed 3 of the 12 required IOP sessions. She attended sessions on September 25, October 2, and October 9, 2023. She has not attended any sessions since October 9, 2023.

9. Ms. Price has not enrolled in parenting classes as required by the treatment plan.

10. Ms. Price does not have stable housing. She has reported to me that she is staying with various friends on a temporary basis. She has not provided a permanent address. DSS provided Ms. Price with three separate housing referrals and offered assistance with housing applications. Ms. Price did not follow through on any of the referrals.

11. Ms. Price submitted to drug screens on October 8, 2023 and October 22, 2023. Both screens were positive for fentanyl. Ms. Price failed to appear for scheduled drug screens on December 5, 2023, January 15, 2024, and March 3, 2024. Per DSS policy and the Court's order, missed screens are treated as presumptive positive results.

**pp. 4-5**

12. Over the six months since removal, Ms. Price has made minimal progress on her treatment plan. She has completed 3 of 12 IOP sessions, has not completed parenting classes, has no stable housing, and has had multiple positive drug screens. DSS has provided bus passes, referrals, and assistance with housing applications. Despite these supports, compliance has been insufficient.

13. DSS made the following specific reasonable efforts to assist Ms. Price with reunification:
    - Monthly bus passes were provided to Ms. Price beginning in September 2023 to facilitate her attendance at IOP sessions, parenting classes, drug screens, court hearings, and supervised visitation;
    - Three separate housing referrals were made, including referrals to Richland County Housing Authority, Transitions Homeless Center, and a private apartment complex with income-based units;
    - Transportation assistance for IOP sessions was offered to Ms. Price. She declined this assistance;
    - DSS arranged and facilitated supervised visitation between Ms. Price and the children. Ms. Price attended visitation inconsistently.

14. Brandon Price, the biological father of both children, voluntarily relinquished his parental rights on November 20, 2023.

**p. 6**

15. I have visited the minor children in the Patterson foster home on multiple occasions. Both children are safe, healthy, and thriving. Amari is enrolled in first grade and is performing at grade level. Destiny is enrolled in pre-kindergarten and has adjusted well. The Patterson family provides a stable, nurturing home environment and has expressed their desire to adopt both children.

16. Based on my training, experience, direct observation, and involvement in this case, it is my professional opinion that Crystal Price has failed to remedy the conditions that led to the removal of the children, that her ongoing substance abuse renders her unable to provide minimally adequate care, and that termination of parental rights is in the best interest of both Amari Price and Destiny Price.

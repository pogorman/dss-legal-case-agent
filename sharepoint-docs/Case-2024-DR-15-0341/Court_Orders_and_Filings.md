**BEFORE:** The Honorable Harold Wynn, Family Court Judge

### FINDINGS OF FACT

The Court, having reviewed the ex parte Petition for Emergency Removal and supporting affidavit filed by the South Carolina Department of Social Services ("DSS"), and being fully advised in the premises, hereby finds as follows:

1. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-7-620 and Section 63-7-660.

2. On August 5, 2023, DSS received a referral from Longleaf Elementary School regarding the minor child Amari Price. The referring teacher reported that the child had come to school hungry on multiple occasions, wearing dirty clothes, and had disclosed to school personnel that his mother "sleeps all day" and that "there is no food at home." The referral was documented under DSS Intake Report #23-08-1102.

3. On August 8, 2023, at approximately 10:00 AM, DSS Case Manager Monica Vance conducted an unannounced home visit at 1547 Gervais Street, Apartment 4B, Columbia, South Carolina, the residence of Respondent Crystal Price.

4. Upon entry to the residence, Ms. Vance observed the following conditions:
   - The apartment was in an unsanitary condition;
   - Drug paraphernalia was visible on the kitchen counter, including a burnt spoon and syringe;
   - The refrigerator contained only condiments and a gallon of spoiled milk;
   - Running water had been disconnected due to utility shutoff;
   - Both minor children were present in the living room, unsupervised;
   - The minor child Amari Price reported to Ms. Vance that he was hungry;
   - Respondent Crystal Price appeared to be impaired at the time of the visit.

5. The children's father, Brandon Price, DOB June 19, 1987, has been incarcerated at Kirkland Correctional Institution since March 2023 and is unavailable to assume custody of the children.

6. DSS has conducted two prior investigations involving Respondent in 2021 and 2022, both of which were unsubstantiated.

7. The conditions observed at the home create an imminent risk of harm to the physical health, safety, and welfare of the minor children Amari Price and Destiny Price.

### CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-7-620, the Court may issue an ex parte order for emergency removal of a child when there is probable cause to believe the child is in imminent danger of harm.

2. The evidence presented establishes probable cause to believe that the minor children are in imminent danger of physical harm, neglect, or abuse if they remain in the custody of Respondent.

3. Reasonable efforts to prevent removal are not required where the children face imminent danger. The conditions of the home, including the presence of drug paraphernalia, absence of food, lack of running water, and the impaired state of the sole custodial parent, constitute exigent circumstances warranting immediate removal.

### IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED:

1. The minor children Amari Price, DOB September 28, 2017, and Destiny Price, DOB May 14, 2019, are hereby removed from the custody of Respondent Crystal Price and placed in the emergency protective custody of the South Carolina Department of Social Services.

2. DSS is authorized and directed to place the children in an appropriate emergency foster care placement pending further order of this Court.

3. Respondent Crystal Price is hereby informed of her right to counsel. If Respondent is unable to afford counsel, counsel shall be appointed by this Court.

4. A probable cause hearing shall be held within seventy-two (72) hours of this Order, exclusive of weekends and holidays, to determine whether continued removal is warranted. Said hearing is scheduled for **August 15, 2023, at 9:00 AM** in Richland County Family Court, Courtroom 3A.

5. Respondent Crystal Price shall be served with a copy of the Petition and this Order forthwith.

**APPEARANCES:**

| SC Department of Social Services | Counsel for DSS |
| Crystal Price, Respondent (Mother) | Appointed Counsel |
| Monica Vance | DSS Case Manager |

### FINDINGS OF FACT

This matter came before the Court for a probable cause hearing pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-7-710. The Court, having heard testimony, reviewed exhibits, and considered the arguments of counsel, finds as follows:

1. On August 8, 2023, this Court issued an Emergency Removal Order placing the minor children Amari Price and Destiny Price in the emergency protective custody of DSS.

2. Respondent Crystal Price is present in Court with appointed counsel. Respondent has been advised of her rights under the South Carolina Children's Code.

3. DSS Case Manager Monica Vance testified regarding the conditions observed during the August 8, 2023, home visit at 1547 Gervais Street, Apartment 4B, Columbia, South Carolina. Ms. Vance's testimony was consistent with her written report and the affidavit supporting the Emergency Removal Order.

4. Specifically, Ms. Vance testified that upon entering the apartment, she observed drug paraphernalia on the kitchen counter including a burnt spoon and syringe. The refrigerator contained only condiments and a gallon of spoiled milk. Both children were present in the living room and appeared unsupervised. The minor child Amari Price stated to Ms. Vance that he was hungry. Ms. Vance further testified that Respondent appeared impaired at the time of the visit. Running water to the apartment had been disconnected due to utility nonpayment.

5. Respondent Crystal Price addressed the Court and stated: *"I love my children. I know I need to get help. I will do everything the court asks. Please don't take my babies."* (Court Transcript, p. 18.)

6. The children's father, Brandon Price, is incarcerated at Kirkland Correctional Institution and was not present. No suitable relative placement has been identified at this time.

7. The Court finds that probable cause exists to believe that the minor children were neglected within the meaning of S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-7-20, and that continued removal from the home is necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the children.

### CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-7-710, the Court finds probable cause that the children have been abused or neglected and that remaining in the home would be contrary to the welfare of the children.

2. Reasonable efforts to prevent removal were made by DSS, and no services available could adequately protect the children in the home given the conditions observed.

3. A treatment plan is necessary and appropriate to address the conditions that led to the children's removal, and to facilitate reunification if Respondent demonstrates substantial compliance.

### IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED:

1. The minor children Amari Price and Destiny Price shall remain in the protective custody of DSS pending further order of this Court.

2. Respondent Crystal Price shall comply with the following Court-Ordered Treatment Plan:

   a. **Substance Abuse Evaluation and Treatment:** Respondent shall submit to a comprehensive substance abuse evaluation within thirty (30) days and shall complete all recommended treatment, including but not limited to intensive outpatient programming (IOP). Respondent shall submit to random drug screening as directed by DSS.

   b. **Parenting Classes:** Respondent shall enroll in and complete a court-approved parenting education program within ninety (90) days.

   c. **Stable Housing:** Respondent shall obtain and maintain stable, safe, and appropriate housing suitable for the minor children.

   d. **Employment:** Respondent shall obtain and maintain lawful employment or demonstrate a legitimate source of income sufficient to support the minor children.

   e. **Cooperation with DSS:** Respondent shall cooperate fully with DSS, including but not limited to permitting home visits, attending all scheduled appointments, and complying with all case plan requirements.

3. DSS shall facilitate reasonable supervised visitation between Respondent and the minor children, to occur no less than once per week at a DSS-approved location.

4. A Guardian ad Litem shall be appointed to represent the best interests of the minor children.

5. A Reunification Review Hearing shall be held in ninety (90) days, on or about **November 14, 2023**, to assess Respondent's compliance with the Treatment Plan.

6. Respondent is hereby advised that failure to substantially comply with the Treatment Plan may result in the filing of a Petition for Termination of Parental Rights pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-7-2570.

AND IT IS SO ORDERED.

### FINDINGS OF FACT

This matter came before the Court for a ninety-day review hearing pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-7-1680 to assess Respondent's compliance with the Court-Ordered Treatment Plan entered on August 15, 2023. The Court, having heard testimony, reviewed exhibits, and considered the arguments of counsel, finds as follows:

1. On August 15, 2023, this Court entered an Order requiring Respondent Crystal Price to comply with a Treatment Plan including substance abuse evaluation and treatment, parenting classes, stable housing, employment, and cooperation with DSS.

2. Respondent was evaluated by Dr. Raymond Ellis, Licensed Clinical Social Worker and substance abuse evaluator, on September 10, 2023. Dr. Ellis diagnosed Respondent with Opioid Use Disorder, moderate severity. Dr. Ellis testified that Respondent reported daily opioid use beginning in 2021 following a back injury and that she had not previously sought treatment. Dr. Ellis recommended intensive outpatient treatment consisting of a minimum of twelve (12) sessions, combined with random drug screening and participation in Narcotics Anonymous or a similar peer support program. (Substance Abuse Evaluation Report, pp. 3-4.)

3. **Substance Abuse Treatment Compliance:** Respondent has attended three (3) of twelve (12) required IOP sessions as of the date of this hearing. This represents a compliance rate of twenty-five percent (25%) over a period of approximately two months since the evaluation.

4. **Drug Screening Results:** Respondent tested positive for fentanyl on two (2) separate occasions in October 2023. These results directly contradict Respondent's statement to the Court (see paragraph 7 below).

5. **Parenting Classes:** Respondent has not enrolled in a court-approved parenting education program as ordered.

6. **Housing:** Respondent does not have stable housing. She reports staying with various friends at different locations in Richland County. DSS Case Manager Monica Vance testified that she has attempted six (6) home visits since the August 15 Order and has been able to reach Respondent on only two (2) occasions. (Court Transcript, p. 8.)

7. Respondent Crystal Price addressed the Court and stated: *"I have been trying to get to the IOP sessions but I don't have reliable transportation. I missed some appointments. I am looking for housing but it is hard without income. I am clean now."* (Court Transcript, p. 12.)

8. DSS Case Manager Monica Vance testified: *"Ms. Price has attended only 3 of 12 required IOP sessions. She has not enrolled in parenting classes as ordered. She has had two positive drug screens for fentanyl in October. She does not have stable housing — she reports staying with various friends. I have attempted six home visits and reached her twice."* (Court Transcript, p. 8.)

9. The Court notes that Respondent's assertion that she is "clean now" is contradicted by the two positive fentanyl screens in October 2023, approximately three weeks prior to this hearing.

10. The minor children Amari Price and Destiny Price were placed with licensed foster parents Sandra and Michael Patterson on September 25, 2023. The Guardian ad Litem, Thomas Reed, reports that both children are adjusting well to the placement. Amari is enrolled in second grade at Longleaf Elementary and Destiny is enrolled in pre-K at the same school.

### CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. Respondent has failed to substantially comply with the Court-Ordered Treatment Plan entered on August 15, 2023.

2. Continued removal of the minor children from Respondent's custody is necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the children.

3. The permanency plan of reunification shall remain in effect; however, the Court notes that Respondent's current level of compliance is insufficient, and that DSS may petition for termination of parental rights if substantial compliance is not achieved.

### IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED:

1. The minor children Amari Price and Destiny Price shall remain in the protective custody of DSS and shall continue in their current foster care placement with Sandra and Michael Patterson.

2. The Court-Ordered Treatment Plan entered on August 15, 2023, shall remain in full force and effect. Respondent is directed to immediately and substantially comply with all provisions thereof, including but not limited to:

   a. Completion of all twelve (12) IOP sessions as recommended by Dr. Raymond Ellis;
   b. Enrollment in and completion of a court-approved parenting education program;
   c. Obtaining and maintaining stable, safe, and appropriate housing;
   d. Obtaining and maintaining lawful employment;
   e. Submitting to all random drug screens as directed by DSS;
   f. Cooperating fully with DSS, including home visits and scheduled appointments.

3. **Respondent is hereby warned that failure to substantially comply with the Treatment Plan may result in the filing of a Petition for Termination of Parental Rights pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-7-2570.**

4. DSS shall continue to provide reasonable services to assist Respondent in complying with the Treatment Plan, including but not limited to transportation assistance, referrals, and housing application support.

5. Supervised visitation shall continue as previously ordered.

6. This matter shall be reviewed at the next scheduled hearing or upon the filing of a Petition for Termination of Parental Rights, whichever occurs first.

AND IT IS SO ORDERED.

```

**DATE:** November 20, 2023

**BEFORE:** The Honorable Harold Wynn, Family Court Judge

### FINDINGS OF FACT

The Court, having reviewed the Voluntary Relinquishment of Parental Rights executed by Brandon Price and filed with this Court, finds as follows:

1. Brandon Price is the biological father of the minor children Amari Price, DOB September 28, 2017, and Destiny Price, DOB May 14, 2019.

2. Mr. Price is currently incarcerated at Kirkland Correctional Institution, Columbia, South Carolina, where he has been confined since March 2023.

3. On November 20, 2023, Mr. Price executed a written Voluntary Relinquishment of Parental Rights, witnessed and notarized at Kirkland Correctional Institution in accordance with S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-9-310.

4. In his written statement accompanying the relinquishment, Mr. Price stated that he wants what is best for the children and that he cannot parent from incarceration.

5. Mr. Price was advised of his rights prior to executing the relinquishment, including:
   a. The right to legal counsel, and that counsel would be appointed if he could not afford an attorney;
   b. That the relinquishment is irrevocable except as provided by law;
   c. That upon acceptance of the relinquishment, his parental rights and responsibilities regarding the minor children will be permanently terminated;
   d. That the children may be placed for adoption without further notice to him.

6. The Court finds that Mr. Price's relinquishment was executed voluntarily, knowingly, and without coercion or duress.

7. The Court finds that the relinquishment was executed in compliance with the procedural requirements of S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-9-310 et seq.

### CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-9-310, a parent may voluntarily relinquish parental rights by executing a written consent.

2. The voluntary relinquishment executed by Brandon Price meets all statutory requirements and was entered into voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently.

3. Acceptance of the relinquishment is in the best interest of the minor children.

### IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED:

1. The Voluntary Relinquishment of Parental Rights executed by Brandon Price on November 20, 2023, is hereby **ACCEPTED** by this Court.

2. All parental rights, duties, and obligations of Brandon Price with respect to the minor children Amari Price, DOB September 28, 2017, and Destiny Price, DOB May 14, 2019, are hereby **PERMANENTLY TERMINATED**, effective as of the date of this Order.

3. Brandon Price shall have no further right to custody, visitation, or contact with the minor children, except as may be permitted by any future adoptive family at their sole discretion.

4. This Order shall not affect the pending proceedings regarding the parental rights of Respondent Crystal Price.

5. The Clerk of Court is directed to file this Order and update the case record accordingly.

GUARDIAN AD LITEM:
     Thomas Reed, Esq., appointed September 2023
```

**DATE FILED:** February 8, 2024, 10:00 AM

The South Carolina Department of Social Services ("DSS"), by and through undersigned counsel, respectfully petitions this Court for an Order terminating the parental rights of Respondent Crystal Price with respect to the minor children Amari Price and Destiny Price, and in support thereof states as follows:

### I. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

1. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-7-2510 et seq.

2. Venue is proper in Richland County, South Carolina, as the minor children were removed from a residence located in Richland County.

### II. PARTIES

3. Plaintiff is the South Carolina Department of Social Services, the state agency charged with the protection of children pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-7-10 et seq.

4. Respondent Crystal Price, DOB December 3, 1989, is the biological mother of the minor children. Respondent resides at various addresses in Richland County, South Carolina.

5. The biological father, Brandon Price, DOB June 19, 1987, voluntarily relinquished his parental rights on November 20, 2023, which relinquishment was accepted by this Court by Order dated November 20, 2023.

6. Thomas Reed, Esq., was appointed Guardian ad Litem for the minor children in September 2023.

### III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

7. On August 8, 2023, this Court issued an Emergency Removal Order placing the minor children in the protective custody of DSS following an unannounced home visit that revealed unsanitary living conditions, drug paraphernalia, lack of food and running water, and an impaired parent.

8. On August 15, 2023, this Court held a probable cause hearing and found probable cause of neglect. The Court entered a Treatment Plan requiring Respondent to complete substance abuse evaluation and treatment, parenting classes, stable housing, and employment.

9. On November 14, 2023, this Court conducted a ninety-day review hearing and found that Respondent had failed to substantially comply with the Treatment Plan. The Court continued the Treatment Plan and warned Respondent that failure to comply could result in the filing of a TPR petition.

10. On November 20, 2023, Brandon Price voluntarily relinquished his parental rights.

### IV. STATUTORY GROUNDS FOR TERMINATION

DSS seeks termination of parental rights on the following grounds pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-7-2570:

**Ground 1 — Child Neglect (S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-7-2570(1)):**

11. The minor children were neglected as defined in S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-7-20. At the time of removal, the children were living in an unsanitary home with no food, no running water, and drug paraphernalia visible in the presence of the children. Respondent appeared impaired while the children were in her sole care.

**Ground 2 — Failure to Remedy (S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-7-2570(2)):**

12. Respondent has failed to remedy the conditions that caused the removal of the children for a period exceeding six (6) months, despite a Court-Ordered Treatment Plan and reasonable efforts by DSS to assist Respondent.

13. DSS Case Manager Monica Vance attests by affidavit: *"Over the six months since removal, Ms. Price has made minimal progress on her treatment plan. She has completed 3 of 12 IOP sessions, has not completed parenting classes, has no stable housing, and has had multiple positive drug screens. DSS has provided bus passes, referrals, and assistance with housing applications. Despite these supports, compliance has been insufficient."* (TPR Petition, Affidavit, pp. 4-5.)

14. DSS records demonstrate the following services were provided to Respondent to assist with compliance:
    - Monthly bus passes for transportation to IOP sessions and appointments;
    - Three (3) housing referrals;
    - IOP transportation assistance (offered but declined by Respondent);
    - Assistance with housing applications.

**Ground 3 — Substance Abuse (S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-7-2570(4)):**

15. Respondent suffers from a diagnosable condition — Opioid Use Disorder, moderate severity, as diagnosed by Dr. Raymond Ellis on September 10, 2023 — that renders Respondent unlikely to provide minimally acceptable care for the minor children.

16. Respondent tested positive for fentanyl on October 8, 2023, and October 22, 2023. Respondent failed to appear for scheduled drug screens on December 5, 2023, January 15, 2024, and March 3, 2024.

### V. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN

17. The minor children have been in foster care since August 8, 2023, a period of approximately six (6) months.

18. The children are currently placed with Sandra and Michael Patterson, a licensed foster family in Richland County. Both children are thriving in this placement. Amari is performing at grade level in second grade and Destiny has adjusted well to pre-K.

19. The Guardian ad Litem, Thomas Reed, Esq., has visited the children three times in the Patterson home and reports: *"Both children are thriving — Amari is performing at grade level and Destiny has adjusted well to pre-K. The Pattersons provide a stable, loving home and wish to adopt. In my assessment, termination of parental rights and adoption is in the best interest of both children."* (GAL Report, pp. 1-2.)

20. The Patterson family has expressed their intent to adopt both children if TPR is granted.

| Thomas Reed, Esq. | Guardian ad Litem |

### FINDINGS OF FACT

This matter came before the Court for a probable cause hearing on the Petition for Termination of Parental Rights filed by DSS on February 8, 2024. The Court, having heard testimony, reviewed exhibits, and considered the arguments of counsel and the recommendation of the Guardian ad Litem, finds as follows:

**Procedural History:**

1. On August 8, 2023, the minor children were removed from Respondent's custody by Emergency Removal Order of this Court based upon findings of neglect, including unsanitary home conditions, presence of drug paraphernalia, lack of food and running water, and Respondent's impaired state.

2. On August 15, 2023, this Court entered a Treatment Plan ordering Respondent to complete substance abuse treatment, parenting classes, stable housing, and employment.

3. On November 14, 2023, this Court found at the ninety-day review that Respondent had failed to substantially comply with the Treatment Plan and warned that a TPR petition may result.

4. On November 20, 2023, the children's father, Brandon Price, voluntarily relinquished his parental rights, which were terminated by Order of this Court.

5. On February 8, 2024, DSS filed the instant Petition for Termination of Parental Rights on the grounds of child neglect, failure to remedy, and substance abuse.

**Current Compliance Status:**

6. DSS Case Manager Monica Vance testified regarding Respondent's compliance since the filing of the TPR Petition. Ms. Vance stated: *"Since the TPR petition was filed, Ms. Price has increased engagement. She has now completed 5 of 12 IOP sessions, attended 2 of 8 parenting classes, and obtained a room in a shared house. However, the shared housing would not be appropriate for two children. Her most recent drug screen on April 10 was negative. While there is progress, it remains well below what was ordered eight months ago."* (Court Transcript, p. 10.)

7. The Court notes the following compliance summary as of the date of this hearing, eight (8) months after the August 15, 2023, Treatment Plan Order:

   | Requirement | Status | Compliance |
   |-------------|--------|------------|
   | IOP Sessions (12 required) | 5 completed | 42% |
   | Parenting Classes (8 required) | 2 attended | 25% |
   | Stable Housing | Single room in shared house; not suitable for children | Insufficient |
   | Employment | Part-time employment at gas station | Partial |
   | Drug Screens | Two positive (Oct 2023); three missed; most recent negative (Apr 2024) | Inconsistent |
   | Cooperation with DSS | Increased since TPR filing | Improved |

8. Respondent Crystal Price addressed the Court and stated: *"I have been going to my IOP sessions and parenting classes. I have a place to stay now. I am working part-time at a gas station. I am trying. I want my kids back."* (Court Transcript, p. 20.)

9. The Court acknowledges Respondent's increased efforts since the filing of the TPR Petition. However, the Court finds that Respondent's overall compliance with the Treatment Plan over the eight-month period since its entry remains substantially below what was ordered. Five of twelve IOP sessions and two of eight parenting classes in eight months does not constitute substantial compliance. The housing obtained, while a step forward, is a single room in a shared house that is not appropriate for two young children.

**Guardian ad Litem Recommendation:**

10. Guardian ad Litem Thomas Reed testified: *"While I acknowledge Ms. Price's recent efforts, the children have now been in foster care for eight months. They are bonded with the Patterson family and are stable for the first time in their lives. Further delays in permanency are not in the children's best interest. I continue to recommend TPR."* (GAL Report, Updated, p. 2.)

**Status of the Children:**

11. The minor children continue to reside with foster parents Sandra and Michael Patterson. Both children are reported to be thriving. The Patterson family continues to express their intent to adopt both children.

### CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-7-2550, the Court must determine at a probable cause hearing whether there is probable cause to believe that one or more of the statutory grounds for termination of parental rights exists.

2. The Court finds that probable cause exists to believe that the following statutory grounds for termination of parental rights under S.C. Code Ann. Section 63-7-2570 are present:

   a. **Section 63-7-2570(1) — Neglect:** The children were removed due to substantiated neglect, including unsanitary living conditions, presence of drug paraphernalia, lack of food and running water, and the impaired state of the sole custodial parent.

   b. **Section 63-7-2570(2) — Failure to Remedy:** Respondent has failed to remedy the conditions that caused the removal of the children for a period exceeding six (6) months, despite a Court-Ordered Treatment Plan and reasonable efforts by DSS.

   c. **Section 63-7-2570(4) — Substance Abuse:** Respondent has a diagnosed Opioid Use Disorder and has demonstrated an inconsistent pattern of treatment compliance, positive drug screens, and missed screens.

3. Probable cause having been established, this matter shall proceed to a merits hearing on the TPR Petition.

### IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED:

1. The Court finds **PROBABLE CAUSE** exists to support the grounds for termination of parental rights alleged in the Petition filed February 8, 2024.

2. This matter is hereby set for a **MERITS HEARING** on the Petition for Termination of Parental Rights, to be held on **July 15, 2024, at 9:00 AM** in Richland County Family Court.

3. The minor children Amari Price and Destiny Price shall remain in the protective custody of DSS and shall continue in their current foster care placement with Sandra and Michael Patterson.

4. Respondent Crystal Price is directed to continue compliance with the Treatment Plan previously ordered by this Court. The Court notes that Respondent's compliance between the date of this Order and the merits hearing will be considered by the Court at the merits hearing.

5. DSS shall continue to provide reasonable services to Respondent as previously ordered.

6. The Guardian ad Litem shall file an updated report no later than fourteen (14) days prior to the merits hearing.

7. All parties and counsel shall be prepared to present evidence at the merits hearing. The merits hearing shall be a full evidentiary hearing at which DSS bears the burden of proving the grounds for termination by clear and convincing evidence.

8. Respondent is advised of her right to a jury trial on the merits of the TPR Petition and shall notify the Court in writing no later than thirty (30) days prior to the merits hearing if a jury trial is requested.

```
AND IT IS SO ORDERED.

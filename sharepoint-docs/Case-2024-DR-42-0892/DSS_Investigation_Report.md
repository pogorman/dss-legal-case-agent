## I. Intake Summary

On June 12, 2024, at approximately 7:30 AM, the Spartanburg County Department of Social Services received a mandatory abuse/neglect report from Dr. Anita Chowdhury, board-certified attending pediatrician at Spartanburg Medical Center, regarding a three-year-old male child, Jaylen Webb (DOB: April 10, 2021). The child had been admitted to the emergency department earlier that morning at approximately 3:15 AM with injuries including a bilateral femur fracture of the right leg and a spiral fracture of the left humerus. Dr. Chowdhury's medical opinion, documented in the medical records, stated that the injuries were non-accidental in nature and had occurred at different times. The fracture pattern was assessed as inconsistent with the reported mechanism of injury, which the parents described as a fall from the child's crib. A concurrent report was filed with the Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office.

The child's parents are Marcus Webb (DOB: March 15, 1991), father, and Dena Holloway (DOB: August 22, 1993), mother. Both parents reside together at 412 Oak Hollow Road, Spartanburg, South Carolina. Mr. Webb is employed as a warehouse associate. Ms. Holloway is employed part-time as a home health aide. A records check confirmed that neither parent has any prior DSS history or prior investigations.

## II. Initial Assessment

On June 13, 2024, at 9:00 AM, I, Renee Dawson, Senior Case Manager with Spartanburg County DSS, was assigned to this case and proceeded to Spartanburg Medical Center to conduct an initial assessment and interview the mother, Dena Holloway. I have eight years of experience as a case manager with the Department and have conducted initial home assessments and all subsequent visits in this matter.

Prior to conducting the interview, I reviewed the available medical records and consulted briefly with nursing staff regarding the child's condition. Jaylen Webb was resting in a pediatric bed with his right leg immobilized and his left arm in a splint. He appeared lethargic but responsive. The nursing staff confirmed the child had been stable since admission.

According to available records and statements taken by medical staff upon admission, the sequence of events reported by the parents is as follows. On the evening of June 11, 2024, at approximately 10:00 PM, Marcus Webb states that he put Jaylen to bed. Mr. Webb reported to medical staff that the child had been behaving normally throughout the day, running around and playing as usual. He stated that after putting Jaylen down, he fell asleep on the couch while watching television. He reported that the next thing he knew, Ms. Holloway was shaking him and telling him something was wrong with Jaylen.

Ms. Holloway reported to medical staff upon arrival at the ER that at approximately 2:00 AM on June 12, 2024, she heard Jaylen crying loudly from his room. She stated that she went in and found the child in his crib, unable to move his left leg. She told the nursing staff, "I heard him crying around 2 AM. I went in and he couldn't move his leg. I think he fell out of his crib. Marcus put him to bed, I was in the bedroom." Both parents then drove the child to Spartanburg Medical Center.

Upon admission at approximately 3:15 AM, x-rays revealed the bilateral femur fracture and spiral fracture of the left humerus. Dr. Chowdhury assessed the injuries as inconsistent with a fall from a standard crib height. The spiral fracture of the left humerus, she noted, indicated torsional force. Of critical importance, the radiographic findings suggested that the femur fracture was approximately 24 to 48 hours older than the humerus fracture, indicating two separate injury events rather than a single fall.

## III. Interview Notes

### A. Interview with Dena Holloway -- Hospital (June 13, 2024, 9:00 AM)

I interviewed Ms. Holloway at Jaylen's bedside at Spartanburg Medical Center. I identified myself as a DSS case manager and explained the purpose of my visit, including her rights and the nature of the investigation.

--- Page 5 ---

Ms. Holloway stated that Marcus was the only adult present with Jaylen after bedtime on the night of June 11. She told me: "Marcus was the only one with Jaylen after bedtime. I was in our bedroom with the door closed. I didn't hear anything until 2 AM when Jaylen started screaming." She maintained that she believed the child had fallen from his crib. When I asked whether she had any concerns about Mr. Webb's interactions with Jaylen, she did not respond directly and instead repeated that she had been in the bedroom all evening.

During my initial interview with Ms. Holloway at the hospital, she appeared nervous and avoided eye contact when discussing the evening of June 11. Her responses were brief and she frequently looked toward the door, as though expecting someone to enter. I noted that she did not ask me any questions about the investigation process, which is unusual in my experience, as parents in these situations typically have many questions about what will happen next.

--- Page 6 ---

It is significant to note that Ms. Holloway's account changed substantially between this hospital interview and a subsequent interview conducted by law enforcement later that same day. During a follow-up interview at the Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office on the afternoon of June 13, conducted by Lt. Frank Odom, Ms. Holloway revised her statement. She disclosed that at approximately 9:30 PM on the evening of June 11 -- prior to the time Mr. Webb reported putting Jaylen to bed -- she heard a loud thump from Jaylen's room. She stated that she assumed Marcus was in there with the child. She called out, and Marcus responded that everything was fine. She did not check on Jaylen at that time. She further disclosed to Lt. Odom that Marcus has a temper and that she has witnessed him grab Jaylen roughly by the arm on two or three occasions when frustrated by the child's crying, stating: "Marcus has a temper. He gets frustrated when Jaylen won't stop crying. I have seen him grab Jaylen roughly by the arm before, maybe two or three times. I should have said something sooner." None of this information was disclosed during my initial interview at the hospital.

### B. Interview with Marcus Webb -- Sheriff's Office (June 13, 2024, 1:30 PM)

I was not present for the law enforcement interview of Mr. Webb; however, I have reviewed Lt. Odom's report. Lt. Odom interviewed Marcus Webb at the Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office at approximately 1:30 PM on June 13. Mr. Webb stated that he was on the couch all night and did not go into Jaylen's room after he put the child down. He denied witnessing any fall. He suggested that the child may have climbed out of the crib and fallen, stating that Jaylen had been trying to climb out lately. He denied ever handling Jaylen roughly and stated that he did not know how the injuries occurred.

When confronted with the inconsistency between his statement and Ms. Holloway's statement regarding his presence in or near the child's room at 9:30 PM, Mr. Webb stated: "Dena and I have been arguing a lot lately but I would never hurt my son. I don't know why she is saying I was in the room. I was not in his room after 10 PM."

### C. Interview with Marcus Webb -- DSS Follow-up (June 14, 2024)

On the morning of June 14, 2024, prior to the filing of the emergency custody petition, I spoke briefly with Mr. Webb by telephone. He was cooperative in tone and stated: "I love my son. I want to cooperate with DSS. I will do whatever the court says. I did not hurt Jaylen and I don't know what happened to him." Mr. Webb did not provide any additional information regarding the events of June 11. He did not request an attorney at that time and indicated he was willing to participate in any services ordered by the court.

### D. Interview with Dena Holloway -- DSS Follow-up (June 14, 2024)

On the morning of June 14, I also spoke with Ms. Holloway by telephone. Her demeanor was noticeably different from the hospital interview the day before. She was more forthcoming and expressed concern for Jaylen's safety. She stated: "I want Jaylen to be safe. If my mama can take him, that would be best right now. I don't feel safe with Marcus around Jaylen until we figure out what happened." Ms. Holloway provided contact information for her mother, Theresa Holloway (DOB: November 5, 1962), who resides at 88 Creekside Lane, Greenville, South Carolina. Ms. Theresa Holloway is a retired educator. Ms. Dena Holloway stated that her mother would be willing to provide temporary care for Jaylen and requested that DSS explore kinship placement.

## IV. Observations and Analysis

### A. Medical Evidence

The medical evidence in this case is deeply concerning. Dr. Chowdhury's findings, documented in the medical records, indicate that the child's injuries are non-accidental. The spiral fracture of the left humerus is consistent with torsional force -- that is, twisting -- rather than an impact from a fall. The bilateral femur fracture is inconsistent with a fall from a standard crib height for a child of Jaylen's age and weight. Most critically, the radiographic evidence demonstrates that the two fractures are at different stages of healing, with the femur fracture estimated to be 24 to 48 hours older than the humerus fracture. This means the injuries occurred during two separate events, days apart. Both parents' accounts, which describe a single nighttime event, are contradicted by this medical evidence.

### B. Inconsistencies Between Parental Accounts

Multiple significant discrepancies exist between the parents' statements, as well as within Ms. Holloway's own evolving account.

First, regarding Mr. Webb's presence in the child's room: Mr. Webb maintains that he did not re-enter Jaylen's room after putting him to bed at 10:00 PM. Ms. Holloway's revised statement to Lt. Odom places Mr. Webb in or near the room at 9:30 PM, thirty minutes before the stated bedtime, when she heard a thump and Mr. Webb responded that everything was fine.

Second, regarding the timing of injury discovery: If the thump at 9:30 PM represents the injury event -- or one of the injury events -- there was an approximate four-and-a-half-hour delay before the parents sought medical attention. Medical staff have noted that this delay is concerning.

Third, regarding the history of rough handling: Mr. Webb denies ever handling Jaylen roughly. Ms. Holloway states that she has witnessed him grab the child roughly by the arm two or three times when frustrated. There are no prior DSS reports supporting either account, but Ms. Holloway's disclosure suggests a pattern of behavior that was not previously reported to any authority.

Fourth, regarding single versus multiple injury events: Both parents' statements imply a single overnight incident. The medical evidence definitively contradicts this, confirming at least two separate trauma events occurring days apart.

## V. Recommendations

Based on the totality of the information gathered during this investigation, including the medical evidence, parental interviews, law enforcement reports, and my own professional assessment, I make the following recommendations:

Based on my assessment, the child is at imminent risk of harm if returned to either parent at this time. The medical evidence indicates non-accidental trauma and both parents have provided inconsistent accounts. I recommend emergency removal and kinship placement with the maternal grandmother.

Specifically, I recommend:

1. **Emergency Protective Custody:** That the Department file a petition for emergency protective custody of Jaylen Webb and that the child be removed from the custody of both parents pending further investigation and court proceedings.

2. **Kinship Placement:** That Jaylen Webb be placed in kinship foster care with his maternal grandmother, Theresa Holloway, at 88 Creekside Lane, Greenville, South Carolina, contingent upon completion of a satisfactory home study.

3. **Guardian ad Litem:** That the court appoint a Guardian ad Litem to represent the child's interests in all further proceedings.

4. **Case Plan:** That both parents be required to participate in a case plan to include, at minimum, parenting classes, psychological evaluations, and supervised visitation, with all terms to be determined by the court.

5. **Continued Investigation:** That the Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office continue its criminal investigation in coordination with DSS.

## VI. Court Action Taken

On June 14, 2024, at 10:00 AM, the Department filed a petition for emergency protective custody in the Seventh Judicial Circuit Family Court, Spartanburg County. Family Court Judge Margaret Easley granted an ex parte emergency removal order, placing Jaylen Webb in temporary DSS custody. Both parents were served with notice of the order and informed of the date for the probable cause hearing.

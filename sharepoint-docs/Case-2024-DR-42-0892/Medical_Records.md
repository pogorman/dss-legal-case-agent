## EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT ADMISSION RECORD

**Date of Service:** 06/12/2024
**Time of Arrival:** 03:15 AM (via private vehicle)
**Triage Level:** ESI Level 2 — Emergent

### Chief Complaint
3-year-old male presenting with right lower extremity deformity, inability to bear weight, and left upper extremity swelling with pain on palpation. Parents report child "fell out of his crib."

### History of Present Illness
Patient is a 3-year-old male brought to the Emergency Department by his mother, Dena Holloway, and her partner, Marcus Webb (identified as the child's father). Ms. Holloway reports she heard the child crying at approximately 02:00 AM and found him in distress in his bedroom, unable to move his right leg. She states she believes the child fell from his crib. Mr. Webb reports he placed the child to bed at approximately 22:00 on 06/11/2024 and was asleep on the couch at the time of the incident. Neither parent witnessed the event.

On presentation, the child was crying inconsolably and guarding both the right lower extremity and the left upper extremity. The right thigh appeared grossly swollen with visible angulation at the mid-shaft. The left upper arm demonstrated swelling and ecchymosis along the medial aspect. The child withdrew from any attempt to examine or manipulate either extremity.

### Past Medical History
- Full-term birth (39 weeks, vaginal delivery per parent report)
- No prior hospitalizations per parent report
- Immunizations reported up to date (records not available at time of admission)
- No known allergies (NKDA)
- No chronic medical conditions reported
- No prior fractures or orthopedic history reported

### Social History
Child resides with mother (Dena Holloway, age 26) and father (Marcus Webb, age 29) at a residential address in Spartanburg, SC. No siblings in the home per parent report. Father is identified as primary daytime caregiver.

## RADIOLOGY REPORT

**Spartanburg Medical Center — Department of Diagnostic Imaging**

**Exam:** Skeletal survey, pediatric (complete); dedicated views of right femur (AP/lateral) and left humerus (AP/lateral)
**Date:** 06/12/2024, 04:07 AM
**Ordering Physician:** Anita Chowdhury, MD
**Radiologist:** David Petrakis, MD, Diagnostic Radiology
**Clinical Indication:** 3-year-old male with suspected bilateral extremity fractures; evaluate for non-accidental trauma

### Findings

**Right Femur (AP and Lateral Views):**
Transverse fracture of the right femoral shaft at the junction of the proximal and middle thirds. Moderate displacement with approximately 1.5 cm of overriding. Periosteal reaction and early callus formation are present along the fracture margins, indicating the fracture is not acute. Radiographic appearance is consistent with a fracture age of approximately **3 to 5 days** based on the degree of periosteal new bone formation and soft tissue changes. Surrounding soft tissue swelling is prominent.

**Left Humerus (AP and Lateral Views):**
Spiral (oblique) fracture of the left humeral shaft, extending from the mid-diaphysis proximally over a length of approximately 6 cm. Mild displacement with cortical disruption along the posterolateral aspect. Minimal periosteal reaction is present, and soft tissue swelling is acute in character. Radiographic appearance is consistent with a fracture age of approximately **24 to 48 hours**, significantly more recent than the right femoral fracture. The spiral morphology is indicative of rotational/torsional force applied to the extremity.

**Skeletal Survey — Remainder:**
- Skull (AP, lateral): No fractures identified. Sutures are normal for age.
- Spine (cervical, thoracic, lumbar — AP and lateral): No compression fractures. No vertebral body anomalies. Alignment is normal.
- Chest (AP): No rib fractures, acute or healing. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Lungs are clear.
- Pelvis (AP): No fractures. Hip joints appear normally located.
- Bilateral upper extremities (excluding left humerus): No additional fractures.
- Bilateral lower extremities (excluding right femur): No additional fractures.
- Bilateral hands and feet: No metaphyseal corner fractures (bucket-handle fractures). No other osseous abnormalities.

### Radiologist Impression

1. **Right femur:** Transverse mid-shaft fracture with periosteal reaction and early callus formation, estimated fracture age 3-5 days. This fracture predates the reported incident.
2. **Left humerus:** Spiral fracture of the humeral diaphysis, estimated fracture age 24-48 hours. The spiral pattern is consistent with torsional/rotational mechanism of injury.
3. **Fractures are at different stages of healing.** The right femoral fracture is approximately 24-48 hours older than the left humeral fracture, indicating **two separate injury events occurring at different times.**
4. The described mechanism of injury (single fall from a crib) is **biomechanically inconsistent** with bilateral long bone fractures at different healing stages in a child of this age.
5. No additional acute or healing fractures identified on skeletal survey. No metabolic bone disease pattern (e.g., osteopenia, Wormian bones) to suggest underlying bone fragility disorder.

**Recommendation:** Clinical correlation for suspected non-accidental trauma. Consider additional workup including laboratory evaluation for metabolic bone disease if clinically indicated.

## PHYSICIAN ASSESSMENT AND MANDATORY REPORTER NOTIFICATION

**Date:** 06/12/2024
**Time:** 07:30 AM
**Physician:** Anita Chowdhury, MD, FAAP
**Board Certification:** Pediatrics, American Board of Pediatrics (2012)

### Clinical Assessment

I have personally examined the patient, Jaylen Webb (DOB 04/10/2021), and have reviewed all imaging studies and clinical findings obtained during this admission.

**Summary of Injuries:**
- Transverse fracture, right femoral shaft (estimated age: 3-5 days)
- Spiral fracture, left humeral shaft (estimated age: 24-48 hours)

**Medical Opinion:**

The fracture pattern is inconsistent with a fall from a standard crib height. The spiral fracture of the left humerus indicates torsional force. Additionally, radiographic findings suggest the femur fracture is approximately 24-48 hours older than the humerus fracture, indicating two separate injury events.

A single unwitnessed fall from a crib in a 3-year-old child would not be expected to produce bilateral long bone fractures affecting both an upper and lower extremity. The different stages of healing observed on radiographic imaging confirm that these injuries did not occur during a single event. The spiral morphology of the humeral fracture is a recognized indicator of applied rotational force, which is not consistent with a simple fall mechanism.

It is my medical opinion that these injuries are **non-accidental in origin** and are the result of **at least two separate inflicted trauma events** occurring over a period of days.

### Mandatory Report — Suspected Child Abuse/Neglect

Pursuant to South Carolina Code of Laws, Title 63, Chapter 7, Article 3, Section 63-7-310 (Mandatory Reporters), I am filing this report of suspected child abuse/neglect.

| Notification | Agency | Date/Time | Method | Recipient |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SC DSS Intake | SC Department of Social Services, Spartanburg County | 06/12/2024, 07:30 AM | Telephone, followed by written report | DSS Intake Worker (ref: 2024-DR-42-0892) |
| Law Enforcement | Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office | 06/12/2024, 07:30 AM | Telephone notification | Deputy on call, Crimes Against Children Unit |

**Basis for Report:** Non-accidental bilateral long bone fractures in a pre-school-aged child. Injuries at different healing stages inconsistent with reported mechanism. No witnessed event. No plausible accidental explanation provided by caregivers.

_See also: Court Transcript, Probable Cause Hearing, p. 14 — Dr. Chowdhury's testimony: "In my medical opinion, these injuries are non-accidental. A three-year-old falling from a crib would not sustain bilateral long bone fractures of this nature. The different healing stages confirm at least two separate trauma events occurring days apart."_

## PROGRESS NOTES

### Progress Note — 06/12/2024, 09:00 AM
**Author:** Anita Chowdhury, MD

**Subjective:** Patient resting more comfortably after analgesic administration. Intermittent crying with any repositioning. Parents present at bedside. Father (Marcus Webb) asking when the child can go home. Mother (Dena Holloway) tearful and largely quiet.

**Objective:**
- Vitals (08:45): T 98.8 F, HR 128 bpm, RR 24, BP 96/58, SpO2 99% RA
- Right lower extremity immobilized in temporary splint; neurovascular status intact distally
- Left upper extremity in posterior splint; neurovascular status intact distally
- Patient tolerating clear liquids, no emesis
- Pain assessed via FLACC scale: 4/10 (improved from 8/10 on admission post-splinting and analgesia)

**Assessment/Plan:**
1. Bilateral fractures as described — Orthopedic Surgery consulted for definitive management of right femoral fracture (likely spica cast vs. flexible intramedullary nailing given age). Left humerus to be managed with coaptation splint and close follow-up.
2. Non-accidental trauma — DSS and law enforcement notified per mandatory reporting obligation (see p. 5). Social work consulted. Anticipate DSS investigator on-site today.
3. Laboratory workup ordered to rule out metabolic bone disease: calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, PTH, CBC with differential, CMP. Results pending.
4. Pain management: Acetaminophen 15 mg/kg PO q4h PRN; ibuprofen 10 mg/kg PO q6h PRN (alternating). Morphine 0.1 mg/kg IV available for breakthrough pain.

**Author:** Anita Chowdhury, MD

**Subjective:** Patient is resting. Ate approximately half of lunch (chicken nuggets, apple sauce). Voided x2. No fever. Parents remain at bedside. DSS investigator (C. Morales, per nursing report) arrived at 11:45 AM and conducted interviews with both parents separately. Hospital security present per protocol.

**Objective:**
- Vitals (14:00): T 98.6 F, HR 118 bpm, RR 22, BP 94/56, SpO2 99% RA
- FLACC pain score: 3/10
- Splints intact, no evidence of neurovascular compromise
- Lab results returned:
  - Calcium: 9.4 mg/dL (ref: 8.8-10.8) — normal
  - Phosphorus: 5.1 mg/dL (ref: 3.8-6.5) — normal
  - Alkaline Phosphatase: 212 U/L (ref: 100-320 for age) — normal
  - 25-Hydroxyvitamin D: 34 ng/mL (ref: 30-100) — normal

  - CBC: WBC 9.2, Hgb 12.1, Hct 36.4, Plt 278 — all within normal limits
  - CMP: Within normal limits; albumin 4.1, glucose 88

**Assessment/Plan:**
1. Metabolic bone disease workup is **negative**. No laboratory evidence of calcium/phosphorus derangement, vitamin D deficiency, or hyperparathyroidism. This effectively excludes rickets, osteogenesis imperfecta (type not associated with blue sclerae, dentinogenesis imperfecta, or hearing loss — none of which are present), and other metabolic causes of pathologic fracture.
2. Non-accidental trauma assessment unchanged. Injuries remain unexplained by provided history.
3. Orthopedics to evaluate for surgical vs. conservative management of femoral fracture tomorrow AM.
4. Continue current pain management regimen. Patient appears comfortable.
5. Social work follow-up and coordination with DSS ongoing. Patient to remain hospitalized pending orthopedic intervention and DSS safety planning.

## NURSING NOTES

### Nursing Note — 06/12/2024, 03:45 AM
**Author:** Rebecca Torres, RN, BSN — Emergency Department

**Patient Arrival/Triage:** Patient arrived at 03:15 AM via private vehicle, carried in by father (Marcus Webb). Mother (Dena Holloway) followed, visibly upset. Child crying loudly, guarding right leg and left arm. Immediate triage assessment performed; ESI Level 2 assigned. IV access obtained (22g, right hand) with minimal difficulty. Weight obtained: 14.8 kg. Morphine 0.1 mg/kg (1.5 mg) administered IV per ED physician order at 03:38 AM for pain management.

### Nursing Note — 06/12/2024, 04:15 AM
**Author:** Rebecca Torres, RN, BSN

**Parent Interview — Father (Marcus Webb):** During intake history, Mr. Webb provided the following account of events:

> "I put him to bed around ten. He was fine, running around all day. I fell asleep on the couch watching TV. Next thing I know, Dena is shaking me saying something is wrong with Jaylen."

Mr. Webb appeared calm during the interview. He did not express visible alarm regarding the severity of the child's injuries. When asked whether the child had any falls or injuries in recent days, Mr. Webb stated "No, nothing. He's been totally fine." He did not offer an explanation for the right femoral fracture or the differing injury ages. He asked multiple times about estimated discharge timing.

**Nurse observation:** Mr. Webb's reported timeline places the child in bed since 22:00 with no witnessed events. His demeanor was notably composed given the severity of a bilateral fracture presentation in a toddler. This observation is documented for the clinical record.

### Nursing Note — 06/12/2024, 04:40 AM
**Author:** Rebecca Torres, RN, BSN

**Parent Interview — Mother (Dena Holloway):** Ms. Holloway was interviewed separately per department protocol. She provided the following account:

> "I heard him crying around 2 AM. I went in and he couldn't move his leg. I think he fell out of his crib. Marcus put him to bed, I was in the bedroom."

Ms. Holloway was tearful and visibly distressed throughout the interview. When asked where she was between 22:00 and 02:00, she stated she was in her bedroom with the door closed and did not hear anything until 02:00 AM. She stated Mr. Webb was responsible for the child's bedtime routine. When asked about any recent injuries or falls in prior days, she hesitated before responding "I don't think so." She did not provide further detail.

**Nurse observation:** Ms. Holloway's account is generally consistent with Mr. Webb's regarding the timeline of the evening, but neither parent provides an explanation for the femoral fracture, which radiographic evidence suggests occurred 3-5 days prior to presentation. Neither parent reported seeking medical attention for any prior injury. The child's presentation with a multi-day-old untreated femoral fracture suggests a delay in seeking care for a significant injury.

### Nursing Note — 06/12/2024, 06:00 AM
**Author:** Rebecca Torres, RN, BSN

**Status Update:** Patient transferred from ED to Pediatric Unit (Room 4-212) at 05:50 AM. Report given to receiving RN (S. Kirkland). Both parents accompanied patient. Splints intact, IV running at maintenance rate (D5 0.45% NS at 53 mL/hr). Pain managed with scheduled acetaminophen; last morphine dose at 03:38 AM. Dr. Chowdhury notified of transfer completion. Social work referral placed per ED attending order.

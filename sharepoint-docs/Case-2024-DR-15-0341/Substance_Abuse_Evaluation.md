## II. REFERRAL SOURCE AND REASON FOR EVALUATION

Ms. Crystal Price was referred for a comprehensive substance abuse evaluation by Monica Vance, Case Manager with Richland County Department of Social Services (DSS), pursuant to a court order issued on August 15, 2023 by the Honorable Judge Harold Wynn of the Fifth Judicial Circuit Family Court. The court ordered the evaluation as part of a treatment plan following the emergency removal of Ms. Price's two minor children, Amari Price (age 7) and Destiny Price (age 5), on August 8, 2023.

The referral documentation indicates the children were removed after a DSS home visit substantiated findings of neglect, including an unsanitary living environment, absence of adequate food, utility shutoff, and the presence of drug paraphernalia in the home. Ms. Price appeared impaired at the time of the visit. The court-ordered treatment plan requires Ms. Price to undergo a substance abuse evaluation, complete recommended treatment, participate in random drug screening, attend parenting classes, and establish stable housing and employment as conditions for reunification.

## III. PRESENTING PROBLEM

Ms. Price presented for evaluation in a cooperative but subdued manner. When asked about the reason for the evaluation, she stated: "The court told me I had to come. I know I have a problem. I just want my kids back."

Ms. Price acknowledged current daily use of opioids, which she described as prescription pain pills and, when unavailable, illicitly obtained fentanyl. She reported that she began using opioids in approximately 2021 following a back injury sustained while working as a housekeeper at a hotel in Columbia. She stated she was initially prescribed oxycodone by her primary care physician for lumbar strain. When the prescription was not renewed, she began obtaining pills from acquaintances and eventually transitioned to using fentanyl due to cost and availability.

Ms. Price reported that her substance use escalated significantly after her husband, Brandon Price, was incarcerated at Kirkland Correctional Institution in March 2023. She stated that she subsequently lost her employment, fell behind on rent and utility payments, and became increasingly unable to manage the household and care for her children. She expressed feelings of shame and helplessness regarding her current situation.

**Route of Administration:** Oral (pills); patient denies intravenous use
**Frequency of Use:** Daily since approximately mid-2021; escalation to near-continuous use since early 2023
**Last Use:** Patient reports using within the past 24 hours of this evaluation
**Quantity:** Variable; reports spending $40-80 per day when funds are available
**Age of Onset:** Approximately age 31 (2021)
**Precipitating Factor:** Lumbar strain sustained at work; initially prescribed oxycodone

**Other Substances:**

- **Alcohol:** Patient reports occasional social drinking prior to opioid use. Currently denies regular alcohol consumption. States she "can't afford both."

**Prior Treatment History:** Ms. Price reports she has **not** previously sought or received treatment for substance use disorder. She has never attended a detoxification program, inpatient rehabilitation, outpatient treatment, or 12-step program. She stated: "I didn't think it was that bad until everything fell apart."

**Withdrawal History:** Patient describes experiencing symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal when unable to obtain the substance, including nausea, body aches, restlessness, diaphoresis, and insomnia. She has not required medical detoxification to date.

## V. PSYCHOSOCIAL HISTORY

**Family of Origin:** Ms. Price was raised by her maternal grandmother in Hopkins, SC. She reports minimal contact with her biological mother, who struggled with alcohol dependence. She has no relationship with her biological father. She describes her grandmother as a stabilizing figure in her childhood who passed away in 2018.

**Education:** Graduated from Lower Richland High School (2008). No post-secondary education. Reports she "wanted to go to school for nursing" but did not pursue it due to financial constraints.

**Employment:** Ms. Price was employed as a housekeeper at a hotel in Columbia, SC, from 2019 until approximately June 2023, when she was terminated for excessive absences. She sustained the back injury on the job in early 2021. She reports filing a workers' compensation claim, which was denied. She is currently unemployed with no source of income.

**Relationship/Marital History:** Ms. Price married Brandon Price in 2016. She describes the relationship as "up and down" but denies domestic violence. Mr. Price was incarcerated in March 2023 on drug distribution charges and is currently housed at Kirkland Correctional Institution. She reports limited contact with him since his incarceration.

**Children:** Two minor children — Amari Price (DOB 09/28/2017, age 7) and Destiny Price (DOB 05/14/2019, age 5). Both children were removed from the home on August 8, 2023 and are currently placed in foster care. Ms. Price expressed strong desire for reunification.

**Housing:** At the time of removal, Ms. Price was residing at 1547 Gervais St, Apt 4B, Columbia, SC. She has since been unable to maintain that apartment and reports staying with various friends and acquaintances. She does not currently have stable housing.

**Legal History:** No prior criminal charges. Two prior DSS investigations in 2021 and 2022, both unsubstantiated. Current DSS case with TPR petition.

**Trauma History:** Patient reports the death of her grandmother in 2018 as a significant loss. She describes the husband's incarceration and loss of employment as cascading stressors. She endorses a history of childhood emotional neglect related to her mother's alcohol use. She denies history of physical or sexual abuse.

## VI. MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION

Ms. Price presented as a 33-year-old African American female who appeared her stated age. She was dressed casually and demonstrated adequate personal hygiene. She was oriented to person, place, time, and situation. Eye contact was intermittent and frequently averted, particularly when discussing the removal of her children and the extent of her substance use.

**Speech:** Normal rate, rhythm, and volume. Responses were generally coherent and relevant, though occasionally tangential when discussing emotionally charged topics.

**Mood:** Self-described as "sad and scared." Affect was constricted, predominantly dysphoric, and congruent with stated mood.

**Thought Process:** Linear and goal-directed. No evidence of loose associations, flight of ideas, or thought blocking.

**Thought Content:** No suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, or psychotic symptoms endorsed or observed. Patient expressed preoccupation with the custody situation and fear of permanent separation from her children.

**Cognition:** Grossly intact. Patient was able to recall three objects at five minutes and perform serial sevens without difficulty. Insight into her substance use was emerging but limited; she acknowledged "having a problem" but tended to minimize the severity and attribute her situation primarily to external stressors. Judgment was impaired as evidenced by continued daily substance use despite pending custody proceedings.

## VII. CLINICAL ASSESSMENT

Based on the clinical interview, collateral documentation from DSS, and clinical observation, the following findings are noted:

Ms. Price meets diagnostic criteria for **Opioid Use Disorder, moderate severity**, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). She endorses the following diagnostic criteria:

1. Opioids are taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended.
2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control opioid use.
3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the opioid, use the opioid, or recover from its effects.
4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use opioids.
5. Recurrent opioid use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, home, or school (loss of employment; removal of children due to neglect).
6. Continued opioid use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of opioids.
7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of opioid use.
8. Tolerance, as defined by a need for markedly increased amounts of opioid to achieve intoxication or desired effect.
9. Withdrawal, as manifested by the characteristic opioid withdrawal syndrome.

Ms. Price endorses nine of eleven DSM-5 criteria, which corresponds to **severe** symptom count; however, considering the duration, trajectory, and her preserved insight and motivation for change, this evaluator assigns a current severity specifier of **moderate** pending treatment response. This classification may be revised upon follow-up.

Ms. Price meets diagnostic criteria for Opioid Use Disorder, moderate severity. She reports daily opioid use beginning in 2021 following a back injury. She has not previously sought treatment. I recommend intensive outpatient treatment, minimum 12 sessions, combined with random drug screening and NA or similar peer support.

It is notable that Ms. Price has no prior treatment history, which is both a risk factor (she has never developed coping strategies or a recovery framework) and a potential protective factor (she has not experienced repeated treatment failures). Her expressed motivation for reunification with her children may serve as a significant extrinsic motivator for engagement in treatment, though extrinsic motivation alone is generally insufficient for sustained recovery without the development of intrinsic motivation through the therapeutic process.

Ms. Price's psychosocial stressors are substantial and include spousal incarceration, unemployment, housing instability, financial hardship, limited social support, and the removal of her children. These factors both contributed to the escalation of her substance use and will serve as ongoing barriers to recovery if not simultaneously addressed through wraparound services.

## VIII. DIAGNOSIS

**Primary Diagnosis:**
- Opioid Use Disorder, Moderate (DSM-5: F11.20)

**Rule Out:**
- Major Depressive Disorder (requires further psychological evaluation; current depressive symptoms may be secondary to substance use and psychosocial stressors)

**Other Conditions for Clinical Attention:**
- Housing instability (Z59.10)
- Unemployment (Z56.0)
- Disruption of family by separation (Z63.5 — children in foster care)
- Spouse incarceration (Z63.1)

## IX. RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the findings of this evaluation, I make the following treatment recommendations for Ms. Crystal Price:

1. **Intensive Outpatient Treatment (IOP):** Ms. Price should be enrolled in an intensive outpatient program with a minimum of **12 sessions** (typically three sessions per week over four to six weeks). The program should include cognitive-behavioral therapy, relapse prevention skills training, psychoeducation regarding opioid use disorder, and motivational enhancement therapy. A program with specific competency in opioid use disorders is preferred.

2. **Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) Evaluation:** Ms. Price should be referred to an addiction medicine physician or certified prescriber for evaluation regarding medication-assisted treatment, including buprenorphine/naloxone (Suboxone) or naltrexone (Vivitrol). Pharmacotherapy significantly improves treatment outcomes for opioid use disorder and should be strongly considered.

3. **Random Drug Screening:** Ms. Price should submit to random urine drug screening at a frequency of no less than twice monthly throughout the treatment period and for a minimum of six months thereafter. Results should be reported directly to the referring DSS case manager, Ms. Monica Vance.

4. **Peer Support / Self-Help Participation:** Ms. Price should attend Narcotics Anonymous (NA) or a similar evidence-based peer support program a minimum of two times per week. She should obtain a sponsor within 30 days of initiating attendance and maintain a meeting log for verification.

5. **Psychological Evaluation:** Given the depressive symptoms observed during the evaluation and the significant psychosocial stressors present, I recommend a comprehensive psychological evaluation to rule out co-occurring mood disorder and to determine whether individual psychotherapy is indicated.

6. **Wraparound Services:** Ms. Price's recovery will be significantly impacted by the resolution of her housing, employment, and transportation barriers. I recommend coordination with DSS and community resources to address these needs concurrently with substance abuse treatment.

7. **Follow-Up Evaluation:** I recommend a follow-up substance abuse evaluation in approximately 90 days to assess treatment engagement, progress, and the need for any modification to the treatment plan.

Ms. Price's prognosis is **guarded**. She presents with a moderate opioid use disorder with daily use, no prior treatment, significant psychosocial stressors, and limited support systems. However, she demonstrates emerging insight, expressed motivation related to her children, and has no prior treatment failures. Successful engagement in the recommended treatment plan, combined with resolution of psychosocial barriers, would materially improve her prognosis.
